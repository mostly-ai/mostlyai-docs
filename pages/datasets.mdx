# Datasets

A dataset is a collection of files and connected data sources grouped together so the Assistant can explore, analyze, and generate insights with the right context.

You can upload datasets from a local file system like your hard drive or use a [connector](./connectors.mdx) to upload from a remote location.

## Create a dataset

For step-by-step instructions on how to upload a dataset, see [Create a dataset](datasets/create.mdx).

To work with demo datasets hosted by MOSTLY AI, check out [Demo datasets](datasets/demo-datasets.mdx). The [Assistant](./assistant.mdx) also has access to several default datasets available out of the box.

## Manage a dataset

After a dataset is created, you can modify it according to your needs. Follow these instructions to [manage an existing dataset](./datasets/manage.mdx).
