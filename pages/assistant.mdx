## Features

The Assistant offers a range of features to use MOSTLY AI resources as well as use your own data resources, such as data files.

### Upload files

You can upload files to the Assistant that you can process with Python or its libraries. For example, you can upload CSV, Parquet, and Excel files for the Assistant to analyze for data insights or create a new datset.

### Use a generator or a synthetic dataset

During a chat, you can reference any existing generator or synthetic dataset as a resource in the conversation.

On the left side of the prompt box, click the **Resources** button and select the **Use a generator** or **Use a synthetic dataset** options. You can then select any of your available resources.
