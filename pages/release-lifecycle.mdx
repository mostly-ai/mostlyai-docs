# Release lifecycle and support

Our guide to software release management and support policies, including semantic versioning, end-of-support details, security updates, and user best practices.

## Release types

**Semantic versioning**. Releases will follow a semantic versioning system. Each release is identified by a version number in the format `vX.Y.Z`, where:

* `X` (major version): Increments signify major changes or breaking changes.
* `Y` (minor version): Increments signify the addition of new features in a backward-compatible manner.
* `Z` (patch version): Increments signify backward-compatible bug fixes or security updates.

Examples

* `v4.0.0`: Initial release of a major version.
* `v4.0.1`: Bug fixes or security updates for the `v4.0.0` release.
* `v4.1.0`: New features added to the `v4.x.x` series.
* `v5.0.0`: Major new features and breaking changes is APIs or models.

## Support

Each version is supported until a new major or minor version is released. For example, once `v4.1.0` is released, there will be no new updates (e.g., patches) to `v4.0.x`. Bug fixes and security fixes are guaranteed by updating to the latest release.

For all releases:

* End of support occurs when a newer major or minor version is released.
* After this point, no further updates (including security patches) will be provided for the old version.

## Release cadence

* Releases will occur as needed, with no specific cadence. It is possible to have multiple releases per week, including major, minor, or patch updates.
* Each release will supersede the previous version in its series (major or minor).

## Security updates

* Security updates can be provided at any release level: patch (Z increment), minor (Y increment), or major (X increment).
* These updates address security vulnerabilities and ensure the version remains secure.
* Major versions of internal components - such as databases, tools, and frameworks - may change with major or minor version updates to introduce new features or enhancements.

## Upgrade recommendations

* Users are encouraged to promptly update to the latest release to benefit from new features, security patches, and bug fixes.
* Security should remain a top priority, and all users are advised to apply updates as soon as they are available.

## Review and revision

This release and support lifecycle document will be periodically reviewed and revised to reflect any changes in the release and support processes.
