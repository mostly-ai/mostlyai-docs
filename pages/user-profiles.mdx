# User profiles

With a personal user profile, you can share your public portfolio of synthetic data resources. Every user in MOSTLY AI can check out your portfolio and use your public resources.

<CustomCallout>
For more information, see [_Public and private resources_](/public-private-resources).
</CustomCallout>

## Set a username for your profile

By default, MOSTLY AI assigns a username if you don't already have one. That auto-generated username is a combination of 5 characters and 5 numbers, such as `dskro74986`.

You can change your username from your account settings.

The following requirements apply to usernames.
    * unique across usernames and organization names in MOSTLY AI
    * 64 characters max length
    * letters, numbers, and dashes only
    * leading, trailing, and double-dashes are not allowed

**Steps**

1. In the upper right, hover over the profile icon and select **Settings**.
2. Under Account details, for Username set the username you want to use.

        width={800}
        height={10}
    />
3. Click **Save**.

**Result**

Your username now prefixes the name of each resource in MOSTLY AI. This includes generators, synthetic datasets, connectors, and chats.

## View your profile

You can easily access your profile from the profile menu.

**Steps**

1. In the upper right, hover over the profile icon and select **Settings**.
2. Select your username.

**Result**

You are now viewing your profile. When you do so, you can see your public and private resources. Private resources have the <PrivateResourceIcon/> Private badge.

When other users view your profile, they can only see your public resources.
