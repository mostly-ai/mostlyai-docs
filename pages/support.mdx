## Delete your account

To delete your MOSTLY AI account, you can use the **Settings** option from the user profile menu.

**Prerequisites**

Deleting your account is a permanent action that also deletes any resources you are the owner of. Before you proceed, check if you need to backup any of these resources.

* Download synthetic datasets.
* [Export](/generators/export-import#export-a-generator) generators you are the owner of.
* [Export](/chats/manage-chats#export-as-a-jupyter-notebook) Assistant chats you are the owner of.
* Save available connection information for any connectors you are the owner of. (Passwords and access keys cannot be retrieved.)

**Steps**

1. From the upper right, hover over your profile icon.
2. Click **Settings**.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/user/delete/01-profile-select-settings.webp"
        alt="Hover over your profile icon"
        width={300}
        height={200}
    />
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
4. Click **Delete my account**.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/user/delete/02-click-delete-my-account.webp"
        alt="Click Delete my account"
        width={800}
        height={200}
    />
5. To confirm, click **Yes, delete my account**.

**Result**

MOSTLY AI ends your user sessions and logs you out. Your account is then deleted. Any resources (generators, synthetic datasets, connectors, Assistant chats) that you are the owner of are also deleted.
