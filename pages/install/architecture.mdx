# Architecture

MOSTLY AI runs as a set of containerized applications and services that you can deploy in a Kubernetes cluster and maintain a fault-tolerant and highly available application.

## Application Nodes

|     | <div style={{width: '152px'}}>Pod and image name</div> | Description | Pod Lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <WebFrontendIcon/> Web frontend          | **mostly-ui**<br /><br />`mostly-app-ui`                           | Contains the frontend of MOSTLY AI. Reachable over port `8080`. | Service |
| <TerminalIcon/> Backend                  | **mostly-app**<br /><br />`mostly-app-enterprise`                  | Contains the backend and public APIs of MOSTLY AI. | Service |
| <DatabaseLockIcon /> Coordinator Service | **mostly-coordinator**<br /><br />`mostly-coordinator`             | Component that takes all requests from the web application and coordinates execution of tasks on the main AI engine. | Service |
| <StorageIcon /> Data discovery           | **mostly-core-api**<br /><br />`mostly-core-api`                   | Component that reads metadata and analyzes data sources and destinations. | Service |
| <UserPersonaIcon /> Keycloak             | **mostly-keycloak**<br /><br />`mostly-keycloak`                   | Keycloak is an open-source identity management, authentication, and authorization tool. This container has a pre-configured Keycloak instance for MOSTLY AI. | Service |

## Third-party integrations and connections

Active Directory is an optional integration that can help you manage the authentication of users to MOSTLY AI. With this integration, end users do not need to create new credentials to log in to MOSTLY AI.

### Image repository

The MOSTLY AI image repository contains the deployment images of all containers and makes it easy to deploy MOSTLY AI to various types of Kubernetes clusters.

### Corporate databases

MOSTLY AI can connect to your internal databases (with the help of [connectors](/connectors)) and read original data or deliver the generated synthetic data in the same or another database.

### Cloud storage buckets

In addition to databases, you can also read original data and deliver synthetic data from and to cloud storage buckets (AWS S3, Azure blob storage, Google Cloud storage buckets).

### LLM services

The Assistant Broker can connect to any Large Language Model (LLM) service that supports tool calling via LiteLLM. This includes publicly available LLM services such as Claude or OpenAI, or privately hosted LLM services deployed within your customer infrastructure. This integration enables the assistant service to provide intelligent responses and coordinate code execution through the internal Jupyter Hub nodes.

### Storage requirements

MOSTLY AI uses two types of storage.

* **Block Storage**. Used by single pods, such as PostgreSQL. Typically, this is automatically provisioned by the Kubernetes cluster.
* **Shared Storage**. Shared by various pods to store models, synthetic data, and others. Two options exist for using shared storage:
    * **MinIO**. MOSTLY AI provides shared storage via [MinIO](https://min.io/). This uses the block storage provisioned by the Kubernetes cluster.
    * **External S3 storage**. You can use an external S3 storage solution instead of MinIO.
