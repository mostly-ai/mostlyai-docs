## Third-party integrations and connections

Active Directory is an optional integration that can help you manage the authentication of users to MOSTLY AI. With this integration, end users do not need to create new credentials to log in to MOSTLY AI.

### Image repository

The MOSTLY AI image repository contains the deployment images of all containers and makes it easy to deploy MOSTLY AI to various types of Kubernetes clusters.

### Corporate databases

MOSTLY AI can connect to your internal databases (with the help of [connectors](/connectors)) and read original data or deliver the generated synthetic data in the same or another database.

### Cloud storage buckets

In addition to databases, you can also read original data and deliver synthetic data from and to cloud storage buckets (AWS S3, Azure blob storage, Google Cloud storage buckets).

### Storage requirements

MOSTLY AI uses two types of storage.

* **Block Storage**. Used by single pods, such as PostgreSQL. Typically, this is automatically provisioned by the Kubernetes cluster.
* **Shared Storage**. Shared by various pods to store models, synthetic data, and others. Two options exist for using shared storage:
    * **MinIO**. MOSTLY AI provides shared storage via [MinIO](https://min.io/). This uses the block storage provisioned by the Kubernetes cluster.
    * **External S3 storage**. You can use an external S3 storage solution instead of MinIO.
