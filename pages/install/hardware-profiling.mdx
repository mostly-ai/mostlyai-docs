# Hardware profiling

Depending on the datasets you need to synthesize, your hardware requirements for MOSTLY AI can differ. Review the results from the MOSTLY AI hardware profiling tests to understand how different data and machine sizes impact memory usage and the duration of AI training and synthetic data generation.
