# Deploy MOSTLY AI to a Google GKE cluster

Welcome to the guide on how to deploy MOSTLY AI to a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster!

Follow the tasks and steps outlined below to configure, deploy, and run MOSTLY AI in Google Cloud.

## Prerequisites

* Install [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
* Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
* Install [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
* Obtain deployment details from your Customer Experience Engineer.
    * **MOSTLY AI Helm chart**. Optional and required only if you intend to [Deploy manually with MOSTLY AI Helm chart](#deploy-manually-with-mostly-ai-helm-chart).
    * **First-time log in credentials** for the MOSTLY AI application. Required in [Log in to your MOSTLY AI Deployment](#log-in-to-your-mostly-ai-deployment).


## Pre-deployment

Before you deploy MOSTLY AI to a GKE cluster, go over the pre-deployment tasks and complete any that are not yet available when you deploy.

* [Task 1: Create a GCP project](#task-1-create-a-gcp-project)
* [Task 2: Create a GKE cluster](#task-2-create-a-gke-cluster)
* [Task 3: Connect to the GKE cluster from your CLI](#task-3-connect-to-the-gke-cluster)
* [Task 4: Configure an ingress controler](#task-4-configure-an-ingress-controller)

### Task 1. Create a GCP project

To create a GKE cluster, you need a project in Google Cloud Platform. The project is the logical container for your GKE cluster. Your Google Cloud Platform monthly billing is accumulated based on the usage of services in a project.

As a best practice, create a dedicated project for MOSTLY AI.

**Steps**

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click the project menu at the top.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/01-create-gcp-project-01-click-project-menu.webp" 
        alt="Google Cloud - Click project menu" 
        width={550} 
        height={150}
    />
3. Click **NEW PROJECT**.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/01-create-gcp-project-02-click-NEW-PROJECT.webp" 
        alt="Google Cloud - Click NEW PROJECT" 
        width={800} 
        height={150}
    />
4. On the **New Project** page, configure the new project.
    1. For **Project name**, enter a name for the project.
    2. For **Organization**, select your organization or select to use another billing account.
    3. For **Location**, select again your organization or click **BROWSE** to select another.
    4. Click **CREATE**.
        <Image
            src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/01-create-gcp-project-03-select-org-click-CREATE.webp"
            alt="Google Cloud - Select organization and click CREATE"
            width={450}
            height={150}
        />
5. Select the newly created project to work with.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/01-create-gcp-project-04-select-new-project.webp"
        alt="Google Cloud - Select project"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />

**Result**

You can now create a GKE cluster dedicated to the MOSTLY AI application in the project.

### Task 2. Create a GKE cluster

The GKE cluster is the container for your MOSTLY AI application. When you create the cluster, you define the number of nodes in the cluster and the type of nodes in the cluster. The type of nodes defines the compute resources that your cluster will have.

**Steps**

1. From the Google Cloud Console, select **Kubernetes Engine** from the sidebar.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/02-create-gke-cluster-01-select-kubernetes-engine.webp"

        alt="Google Cloud - Click CREATE"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
4. Switch to standard cluster creation.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/02-create-gke-cluster-04-switch-to-standard-cluster.webp"
        alt="Google Cloud - Switch to standard cluster"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
5. Click **SWITCH TO STANDARD CLUSTER** in the dialog box.
6. Configure the number of nodes in the cluster.
    1. From the sidebar under **NODE POOLS**, select the **default-pool**.
    2. Under **Size**, set the **Number of nodes** to **1**.
        <Image 
            src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/02-create-gke-cluster-06-configure-nodes-count.webp" 
            alt="Google Cloud GKE - Configure nodes" 
            width={800} 
            height={150}
        />
4. Select a node type and configure the disk size.
    1. From the sidebar on the left, expand **default-pool** and select **Nodes**.
    2. Under **Machine configuration**, select a powerful node to power your MOSTLY AI synthetic data workloads.
    3. For **Machine type**, select the **e2-standard-16** type with 16 vCPUs, 8 cores, and 64GB memory.
    4. For **Boot disk size**, define at least **200GB**.
        <Image 
            src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/02-create-gke-cluster-07-node-type-disk-size.webp" 
            alt="Google Cloud GKE - Configure compute and disk space" 
            width={800} 
            height={150}
        />
6. Leave the remaining default configurations.
7. Click **CREATE** at the bottom.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/02-create-gke-cluster-08-click-create.webp" 
        alt="Google Cloud GKE - Click CREATE" 
        width={800} 
        height={150}
    />

**Result**

The cluster creation starts. When complete, your cluster status turns green in the list.

**What's next**

Select your cluster after its status turns green. You can then connect to the cluster using your CLI.

<Image 
    src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/02-create-gke-cluster-09-open-cluster.webp" 
    alt="Google Cloud GKE - Open cluster" 
    width={800} 
    height={150}
/>

### Task 3: Connect to the GKE cluster
    
With the GKE cluster created, you can now use your command-line to connect to the cluster.

Make sure that you install `gcloud CLI` and `kubectl` as listed in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

**Steps**

1. With the cluster open, click **CONNECT**.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/03-connect-to-cluster-01-click-connect.webp" 
        alt="Google Cloud GKE - Select Connect to cluster" 
        width={800} 
        height={150}
    />
4. In the modal window **Connect to the cluster**, copy the command to configure your cluster access.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/install/gke/03-connect-to-cluster-02-copy-connect-command.webp" 
        alt="Google Cloud GKE - Copy connect command" 
        width={800} 
        height={150}
    />
5. Open a terminal or a command-line application, and paste and run the command.<br /><br />
    For example, the following is a template command where you need to replace the values for the `<cluster-name>`, `<zone-name>`, and `<project-identifier>` arguments with your relevant values.<br /><br />
    When you copy the command in step 4, the values will be pre-filled for you.
    ```bash
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone-name> --project <project-identifier>
    ```
    If you connected successfully, you will see the following output:
    ```
    Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
    kubeconfig entry generated for <cluster-name>.
    ```

**Result**

The GKE cluster connection is now configured on your local system.

**What's next**

You can now use `kubectl` to communicate with your GKE cluster and `helm` to install and manage packages.

### Task 4: Configure an ingress controller

MOSTLY AI supports HAProxy by default as the ingress controller. NGINX and Istio virtual services are also supported.

For details on how to configure each, see [_Ingress controllers_](../config/ingress-controllers).

## Deployment

You can deploy MOSTLY AI with from the [Google Cloud Marketplace](#deploy-from-the-google-cloud-marketplace) or [manually with the MOSTLY AI Helm chart](#deploy-manually-with-mostly-ai-helm-chart).

### Deploy from the Google Cloud Marketplace

### Deploy manually with MOSTLY AI Helm chart

If you wish to deploy MOSTLY AI manually with the Helm chart, you need to obtain the Helm chart from your MOSTLY AI Customer Experience Manager. You can then configure your deployment in the `values.yaml` file and use the `helm` command to start the deployment process.

The `values.yaml` file is part of the [MOSTLY AI Helm chart](/install/deploy/helm-chart). The Helm chart includes configuration files that define the resources and configurations needed to deploy MOSTLY AI.

**Steps**

1. Open the `values.yaml` file in a text editor.
2. At the start, set the application domain name to an FQDN.
    <Callout>
    `minio` is the shared storage service.
    </Callout>
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {3-4}
    _customerInstallation:
      domainNames:
        mostly-ai: &fqdn yourfqdn.com
    ```
2. (Optional) Apply one of the configurations below depending on whether you intend to use TLS-encrypted access to the MOSTLY AI application.<br /><br />
    **➡️ You use an TLS certificate**. Replace `your-tls-secret` with the TLS secret name as defined in your cluster configuration.
    <Callout>
    Your IT department or Kubernetes administrator creates the FQDN and its TLS certificate and adds it to the configuration of your cluster. When added, it comes with a TLS secret name that you can define in the `values.yaml` file. For details, see [_Configure your domain TLS certificate_](/install/config/domain-tls-cert).
    </Callout>
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {4}
    _customerInstallation:
    ...
      deploymentSettings:
        tlsSecretName: &tlsSecretName your-tls-secret
    ...
    ```
    **➡️ You do not use an TLS certificate**. Replace the  `your-tls-secret` with an empty string and, for `global.tls`, set `enabled` to `false`. 
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {4,9}
    _customerInstallation:
    ...
      deploymentSettings:
        tlsSecretName: &tlsSecretName [] # your-tls-secret
    ...
    global:
      ...
      tls:
        enabled: false
    ...
    ```
3. (Optional) If you host third-party container images in an internal repository, replace `docker.io` in `registryFor3rdPartyComponents`.
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {5}
    _customerInstallation:
    ...
      deploymentSettings:
      ...
        registryFor3rdPartyComponents: &registryFor3rdPartyComponents docker.io
    ...
    ```
4. (Optional) If you need to host MOSTLY AI container images in an internal repository, replace `quay.io/mostlyai` in `mostlyRegistry`.
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {5}
    _customerInstallation:
    ...
      deploymentSettings:
      ...
        mostlyRegistry: &mostlyRegistry quay.io/mostlyai
    ...
    ```
5. (Optional) If you intend to use the MOSTLY AI image repository at `quay.io/mostlyai`, set its secret in `mostlyRegistryDockerConfigJson`.
    <Callout>
    To obtain the secret, contact your MOSTLY AI Customer Experience Engineer.
    </Callout>
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {5}
    _customerInstallation:
    ...
      deploymentSettings:
      ...
        mostlyRegistryDockerConfigJson: &mostlyRegistryDockerConfigJson <HARBOR_SECRET>
    ...
    ```

**Result**

Your `values.yaml` file is now configured with the required settings for your MOSTLY AI deployment.

**Result**

The MOSTLY AI applications and services pods are queued for start up in your GKE cluster.

**What's next**

You can track the startup progress in Kubernetes Engine on the **Workloads** tab. While the pods are starting, you might see the status column showing errors, such as `Does not have minimum availability`.

Give the pods some time (~5-10 minutes) to start and establish the necessary connections between services.

After you see that all pods have a successful startup, you can continue with the post-deployment tasks.

## Post-deployment

With the MOSTLY AI pods running, you can now log in to your MOSTLY AI deployment for the first time.

### Log in to your MOSTLY AI deployment

Log in for the first time to your MOSTLY AI deployment to set a new password for the `superadmin` user.

**Prerequisites**

Contact MOSTLY AI to obtain the supeadmin credentials as you need them to log in for the first time.

**Steps**

1. Open your FQDN in your browser.<br />
    **Step result**: You **Sign in** page for your MOSTLY AI deployment opens.
    <Image
