# MOSTLY AI Helm chart

To deploy MOSTLY AI in a Kubernetes cluster that your organization owns and configures, MOSTLY AI provides a Helm chart. [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes and a [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) is the package format.

## Contents
The MOSTLY AI Customer Success team provides clients with the Helm chart that includes the `MOSTLY_AI_helm_charts` folder. You can review the root contents of the folder below.

```
Chart.yaml          # A YAML file that contains information about the chart
README.md           # Helm chart README file
templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                    # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.
values.yaml         # The configuration values for this Helm chart
```

## Edit and configure the Helm chart

To configure your deployment, you need to edit the `values.yaml` file, and in rare cases, the files in the `templates/` directory.

The `values.yaml` file contains many of the required configurations for different types of Kubernetes clusters. Each deployment guide includes steps which contain excerpts from the `values.yaml` file to indicate sections of the required configurations for a specific deployment. The excerpts are small sections from the file. Contents preceding and following the excerpts are indicated with an ellipsis (...).

For mode information, see the [deployment guides](../deploy) for each supported cloud platform provider.

## Delivery of images in the MOSTLY AI Helm chart

You can deploy the container images defined in the Helm chart from the MOSTLY AI image repository or from an internal image repository.

You need to make sure that your Kubernetes cluster has Internet connectivity to download the images from the MOSTLY AI repository.

Similarly, you need direct connectivity from your cluster to your internal image repository, if you plan to use that option.
