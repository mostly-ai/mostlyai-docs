# Configure an internal image repository

Due to internal IT and security policies, you might need to host the MOSTLY AI container images in an internal repository.

For such cases, you need to edit the `values.yaml` file in the [Helm chart](/install/deploy/helm-chart) and specify the URL and path to the MOSTLY AI images.

You can find the configuration steps below. Complete before deploying.

**Prerequisites**

- Obtain the MOSTLY AI images from your Customer Success Engineer.
- Work with your IT team to host the images in an internal repository.
- Make sure that your Kubernetes cluster can access the internal image repository.
- Obtain the repository URL from your IT team.
- Obtain the image pull secret for your internal repository from your IT team.

**Steps**

1. In the `MOSTLY_AI_Helm_charts` directory, edit the `values.yaml` file.
2. In the `mostlyRegistry` line, set the internal MOSTLY AI images repository URL.
   ```yaml filename="values.yaml" {5}
   _customerInstallation:
   ...
     deploymentSettings:
     ...
       mostlyRegistry: &mostlyRegistry your.internal.image.registry.com/mostlyai
   ...
   ```
3. Set the name of the secret to your repository in `global.image.mostlyPullSecret`.
   ```yaml filename="values.yaml" {6}
   ...
   global:
   ...
       image:
         mostlyRegistry: *mostlyRegistry
         mostlyPullSecret: name-of-the-secret-to-your-repository
   ...
   ```
4. Set `mostlyConfigurations.secrets.dockerConfig.create` to `false`.

   ```yaml filename="values.yaml" {5}
   ---
   mostlyConfigurations:
     secrets:
       dockerConfig:
         create: false
   ```

5. Save the `values.yaml` file.

**What's next**

Check the [deployment checklist](../deploy/checklist) for any additional configurations that might be required.

You can then continue with the [deployment](../deploy) of MOSTLY AI.
