# Configure your domain SSL certificate

To deploy MOSTLY AI, you need to configure SSL certificates for your fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to enable secure access to the MOSTLY AI web app.

**Prerequisites**

* Obtain your FQDN SSL certificate from your IT department.
* Obtain the name of the secret that your IT department creates in the Kubernetes management console. If you have access to the Kubernetes cluster and the certificate, you can create the secret with the following command:
    ```bash copy
    kubectl create secret generic mostly-tls-secret --from-file=certificate.pem -n <namespace>
    ```

**Steps**

1. Copy the SSL certificate in the `MOSTLY_AI_Helm_chart` directory.
2. Change directory to `templates/`.
3. Edit the files:
    * `mostly-app-ingress.yaml`
    * `mostly-keycloak-ingress.yaml`
    * `mostly-ui-ingress.yaml`
4. In each file, add the lines between the ellipsis inside the `spec` block (as shown in the excerpt):
    ```yaml
        spec:
        ...
            tls:
                - hosts:
                    - {{ .Values.ingress.fqdn }}
                secretName: MOSTLY_TLS_SECRET
        ...
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
    Replace `MOSTLY_TLS_SECRET` with the name of the secret configured by your IT department in the Kubernetes management console.
    </Callout>
4. In the root of the Helm chart, edit `values.yaml` and update the `ingress.fqdn` value with your FQDN.
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" {2}
    ingress:
        fqdn: mostly.domain.comm
        ...
    ```
5. Save all three files.

**What's next**

Check the [deployment checklist](../deploy/checklist) for any additional configurations that might be required. You can then continue with the [deployment](../deploy) of MOSTLY AI.
