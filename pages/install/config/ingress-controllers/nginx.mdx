# Install and configure NGINX Ingress Controller

You can use NGINX as the ingress controller for your MOSTLY AI deployment. NGINX makes it possible to assign a LoadBalancer IP address to your cluster. You can then assign a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) to the IP address and make the MOSTLY AI web application accessible to your users in your organization.

* [**Configure NGINX**](#configure-nginx). Learn the configuration steps required to use NGINX as the ingress controller for your MOSTLY AI deployment.

## Install NGINX

Install the NGINX ingress controller to assign a LoadBalancer IP address to your cluster. You can then assign a FQDN to the IP address and make the MOSTLY AI web application accessible to your users in your organization.

**Steps**

1. Add the helm chart repository for the Ingress NGINX Controller.
    ```shell copy filename="shell"
    helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
    ```
    
    You should see the following result:
    ```
    "ingress-nginx" has been added to your repositories
    ```
2. Install the Ingress NGINX Controller.
    ```shell copy filename="shell"
    helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
    ```

**Result**

The Ingress NGINX Controller is now installed for your GKE cluster. You might see a result similar to the output below.

Note the line that indicates that you are now waiting for the LoadBalancer IP to be available and a suggested command to check the status of when the IP is available.

```txt {9,10}
NAME: nginx-ingress
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Sep 28 01:35:44 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
The ingress-nginx controller has been installed.
It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace default get services -o wide -w nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller'

An example Ingress that makes use of the controller:
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: example
    namespace: foo
  spec:
    ingressClassName: nginx
    rules:
      - host: www.example.com
        http:
          paths:
            - pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: exampleService
                  port:
                    number: 80
              path: /
    # This section is only required if TLS is to be enabled for the Ingress
    tls:
      - hosts:
        - www.example.com
        secretName: example-tls

If TLS is enabled for the Ingress, a Secret containing the certificate and key must also be provided:

  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: example-tls
    namespace: foo
  data:
    tls.crt: <base64 encoded cert>
    tls.key: <base64 encoded key>
  type: kubernetes.io/tls
```

**What's next**

To check if cluster ingress IP address has been assigned, run the following command:
```shell copy filename="shell"
kubectl --namespace default get services -o wide -w nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller
```

If your IP is assigned, you will see it under the `EXTERNAL-IP` column. The `EXTERNAL-IP` value below is masked on purpose.

```
NAME                                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                      AGE     SELECTOR
nginx-ingress-ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.48.12.255   34.140.40.***   80:31623/TCP,443:32105/TCP   4m41s   app.kubernetes.io/component=controller,app.kubernetes.io/instance=nginx-ingress,app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
```

You can now use your ingress IP and assign it to the domain name that you intend to use for your MOSTLY AI cluster.


## Configure NGINX

Define NGINX as the ingress controller and then enable the required `ingress` annotations.

**Steps**

1. In the `values.yaml` file, assign the `ingressClassName` to be `nginx` under `_customerInstallation.deploymentSettings`.
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {6}
    _customerInstallation:
      ...
      deploymentSettings:
        ...
        ingressClassName: &ingressClassName nginx
        ...
    ```
2. Enable the ingress annotations under `global.ingress.annotations`.
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {3-9}
    global:
        ingress:
            annotations:
              nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 10240m
              nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: 128k
              nginx.org/proxy-connect-timeout: 3000s
              nginx.org/proxy-read-timeout: 3000s
              nginx.org/client-max-body-size: 3000m
            # annotations: {}
    ```

**What's next**

Continue with the MOSTLY AI Helm chart configuration in the related [deployment guide](../../deploy). You can then deploy MOSTLY AI.
