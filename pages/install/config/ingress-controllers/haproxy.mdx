# Enable support for HAProxy

Define HAProxy as the ingress controller in the `values.yaml` file (located in the root of the MOSTLY AI Helm chart).

**Prerequisites**

Ask your Customer Success Engineer to provide a Helm chart with enabled HAProxy.

**Steps**

1. Edit the `values.yaml` file.
2. Assign the `ingressClassName` to be `haproxy` under `_customerInstallation.deploymentSettings`.
   ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {5}
   _customerInstallation:
     ...
     deploymentSettings:
       ...
       ingressClassName: &ingressClassName haproxy
       ...
   ```
3. Save the file.

**What's next**

Continue with the MOSTLY AI Helm chart configuration in the related [deployment guide](../../deploy). You can then deploy MOSTLY AI.
