# Troubleshoot minikube deployment issues

Learn how you can troubleshoot various issues when you deploy MOSTLY AI to a minikube cluster. Each of the listed issues includes a description of the problem and solution that shows how to workaround the issue.

## Cannot upload files

**Problem**

When you attempt to upload files in MOSTLY AI, you might see the error notification `Error while connecting API`.

**Solution**

1. Check if you have enabled the `ingress` add-on in your minikube cluster. For details, see _[Task 10: Install required minikube addons
](/install/deploy/minikube#task-10-install-required-minikube-addons)_.
2. Make sure that you have enabled the `ingress` annotations for the `mostly-app` and `mostly-keycloak` services in the `values.yaml` file as listed below.
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {3-9}
    mostly-app:
        ingress:
            annotations:
              nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 10240m
              nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: 128k
              nginx.org/proxy-connect-timeout: 3000s
              nginx.org/proxy-read-timeout: 3000s
              nginx.org/client-max-body-size: 3000m
            # annotations: {}
    ```

    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" copy {3-7}
    mostly-keycloak:
    ...
        ingress:
            annotations:
                nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 10240m
                nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: 128k
            # annotations: {}
    ```
3. Apply the changes to the `values.yaml` file and redeploy the MOSTLY AI Helm chart.
