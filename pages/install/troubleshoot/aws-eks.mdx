# Troubleshoot Amazon AWS EKS deployment issues

Learn how you can troubleshoot various issues when you deploy MOSTLY AI to an AWS EKS cluster. Each of the listed issues includes a description of the problem and solution that shows how to overcome or workaround the issue.

## AWS reports `VcpuLimitExceeded`

**Problem**

When the deployment script creates a new EC2 instance, you might see the error below.

```
Status Reason: Could not launch On-Demand Instances. VcpuLimitExceeded - You have
requested more vCPU capacity than your current vCPU limit of 32 allows for the
instance bucket that the specified instance type belongs to.
Please visit http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request to request an adjustment to
this limit. Launching EC2 instance failed.
```

**Solution**

You can workaround this issue in one of two ways.

- Request `VcpuLimitExceeded` via http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request
- Use smaller EC2 type instances. For example, **`m5.xlarge`**. Edit `eks-cluster.yaml` and define the instance type in the `WorkerNodesInstanceType` section.
  ```yaml {4}
  WorkerNodesInstanceType:
    Type: String
    Description: EC2 instance type for the worker nodes
    Default: m5.xlarge
  ```

## Region-specific EKS image

**Problem**

By default, the deployment script uses the Standard EKS-optimised AMIs in `eu-central-1` AWS region. This is defined in the `EksAmiIds` section of the `eks-cluster.yaml` file

```yaml filename=eks-cluster.yaml {7}
EksAmiIds:
  # IDs of the "EKS-optimised AMIs" for the worker nodes:
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/retrieve-ami-id.html
  # IMPORTANT NOTE: Choose AWS EKS compatible ami IDs only for the region where you are creating the cluster and it's verion (1.27) in our case.
  # When ami ID found, update below with region and ami ID.
  eu-central-1:
    Standard: ami-02ad6c39e1e54ebc8
```

**Solution**

If you are deploying the MOSTLY AI App in another AWS region different from **`eu-central-1`**, then you need to find the region-specific AWS AMI ID here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/retrieve-ami-id.html. To reflect this, add a new region and a standard AMI ID as shown in the line above in `eks-cluster.yaml`.
