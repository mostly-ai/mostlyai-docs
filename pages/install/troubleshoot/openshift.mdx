# Troubleshoot OpenShift deployment issues

Learn how you can troubleshoot various issues when you deploy MOSTLY AI to an OpenShift cluster. Each of the listed issues includes a description of the problem and solution that shows how to overcome or workaround the issue.

## Cannot list or patch resource

**Problem**

During the [deployment of MOSTLY AI to an OpenShift cluster](../deploy/openshift), you might see one of the errors listed below.

```
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "hello@mostly.ai"
cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```

```
Error from server (Forbidden): namespaces "mostly-ai" is forbidden:
User "hello@mostly.ai" cannot patch resource "namespaces" in
API group "" in the namespace "mostly-ai"
```

The errors appear, when you attempt to run the commands listed below from the [OpenShift deployment guide](../deploy/openshift).

```bash copy
oc get nodes
```

```bash copy
oc annotate --overwrite namespace mostly-ai openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range="1000700000/10000"
```

**Solution**

Request elevated permissions for your user from your OpenShift administrator.

## Violate PodSecurity

The installation error `would violate PodSecurity allowPrivilegeEscalation` might indicate misconfigurations in the `values.yaml` file.

**Problem**

When you run the `helm` command to install MOSTLY AI on an OpenShift cluster, you might see the installation error similar to the one below.

```bash
W0714 14:04:39.656905   47432 warnings.go:70] would violate PodSecurity "restricted:v1.24": allowPrivilegeEscalation != false (container "mostly-*" must set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false), unrestricted capabilities (container "mostly-*" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=["ALL"]), runAsNonRoot != true (pod or container "mostly-*" must set securityContext.runAsNonRoot=true), seccompProfile (pod or container "mostly-*" must set securityContext.seccompProfile.type to "RuntimeDefault" or "Localhost")
W0714 14:04:39.711306   47432 warnings.go:70] would violate PodSecurity "restricted:v1.24": allowPrivilegeEscalation != false (container "mostly-psql" must set securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation=false), unrestricted capabilities (container "mostly-psql" must set securityContext.capabilities.drop=["ALL"])
```

**Solution**

- Verify that you have the correct storage class defined for the `CORDINATOR: pvc: storageClassName` key. To check your OpenShift storageClassNames, open your OpenShift console, and navigate to **Storage** > **StorageClasses**. The name defined for `CORDINATOR: pvc: storageClassName` must match one of the entires.
- Verify that you the `platform` key is set to `ocp` and not `k8s`.
  ```yaml filename="values.yaml"
  platform: k8s # incorrect
  platform: ocp # correct
  ```
- Alternatively, keep in mind that this warning reflects the security constraints in your cluster. To better adapt to the, set the `platform` key to `other`. Like so, the suggested security contexts of the helm charts will be ignored and the deployment will follow the ones from your cluster.
  ```yaml filename="values.yaml"
  platform: other # alternative
  ```

## Failed to create resource

The error `UPGRADE FAILED: failed to create resource: Secret in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Secret` might indicate an incorrect or missing secret key in the `docker_secret` key in the `values.yaml` file.

**Problem**

When you run the `helm` command to deploy MOSTLY AI in an OpenShift cluster, you might see the deployment error similar to the one below.

```bash
UPGRADE FAILED: failed to create resource: Secret in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Secret: illegal base64 data at input byte 6
```

Make sure that you have set the Docker pull image secret in `docker_secret`.

**Solution**

- Double-check that you have the correct secret key in `docker_secret`.
- Make sure that the secret key value is not wrapped in quotation marks.

If the suggestions above do not help to resolve the issue, contact your Customer Experience Engineer.

## Cannot patch "mostly-data" with PersistentVolumeClaim

The error `UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "mostly-data" with kind PersistentVolumeClaim` might indicate intermittent installation issues.

**Problem**

When you run the `helm` command to deploy MOSTLY AI in an OpenShift cluster, you might see an installation error similar to the one below.

```bash
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "mostly-data" with kind PersistentVolumeClaim: PersistentVolumeClaim "mostly-data" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: spec is immutable after creation except resources.requests for bound claims
  core.PersistentVolumeClaimSpec{
  	... // 2 identical fields
  	Resources:        {Requests: {s"storage": {i: {...}, s: "50Gi", Format: "BinarySI"}}},
  	VolumeName:       "",
- 	StorageClassName: &"efs-sc",
+ 	StorageClassName: &"efs",
  	VolumeMode:       &"Filesystem",
  	DataSource:       nil,
  	DataSourceRef:    nil,
  }
```

**Solution**

You can work around the issue above by removing the `mostly-ai` project from your OpenShift cluster, recreating it, and running the installation again.

1. Delete the the `mostly-ai` project from your OpenShift cluster.
   ```bash copy
   oc delete namespace mostly-ai
   ```
2. Create the `mostly-ai` project again.

   ```bash copy
   oc new-project mostly-ai
   ```

   1. Enter the following annotations for the pods of MOSTLY AI to be able to be scheduled in this namespace:

   ```bash copy
   oc annotate --overwrite namespace mostly-ai openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups="1000700000/10000"
   ```

   ```bash copy
   oc annotate --overwrite namespace mostly-ai openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range="1000700000/10000"
   ```

3. Run the deployment again with the `helm` command.
   ```bash copy
   helm upgrade --install mostly-ai ./mostly-combined --values ocp-values.yaml --namespace mostly-ai --create-namespace
   ```

## Keycloak connection error

**Problem**

After you deploy to an OpenShift cluster, you can see in the console error messages related to Keycloak connection errors. Such as the ones listed below.

```
Keycloak connection error #1 - retrying (error: jakarta.ws.rs.ForbiddenException: HTTP 403 Forbidden)
Keycloak connection error #2 - retrying (error: jakarta.ws.rs.ForbiddenException: HTTP 403 Forbidden)
Keycloak connection error #3 - retrying (error: jakarta.ws.rs.ForbiddenException: HTTP 403 Forbidden)
```

**Solution**

1. Log in to Keycloak at `https://{FULLY_QUALIFIED_DOMAIN_NAME}/auth/`.
2. Log in with the admin credentials as documented in [Manage groups](/administration/users-groups#manage-groups), step 2.
3. Select master realm.
4. Select **Realm settings**.
5. For **Require SSL**, select **None**.

6. Click **Save** for the changes to take effect.

The pod will initialize, create the `mostly-generate` realm and the application will be then reachable.
