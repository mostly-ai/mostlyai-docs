# Troubleshoot Azure AKS deployment issues

Learn how you can troubleshoot various issues when you deploy MOSTLY AI to an Azure AKS cluster. Each of the listed issues includes a description of the problem and solution that shows how to overcome or workaround the issue.

## Nginx 404 Not found

**Problem**

**Cause**

Nginx class name is not defined in the Helm charts.

**Solution**

Define the Nginx class name in the `values.yaml` file, for `global.ingress.ingressClassName`.

```yaml {6}
global:
    ...
    ingress:
        annotations:
          route.openshift.io/termination: edge
        ingressClassName: nginx
```

This also requires that you uncomment the nginx annotations in the `values.yaml` file.

```yaml {4-12,17-22}
mostlyApp:
  ...
  ingress:
    # 1. Uncomment the annotations below.
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 10240m
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: 128k
      nginx.org/proxy-connect-timeout: 3000s
      nginx.org/proxy-read-timeout: 3000s
      nginx.org/client-max-body-size: 3000m
    # 2. Comment out the empty annotations line.
    # annotations: {}
    ...
mostlyKeycloak:
  ...
  ingress:
    # 1. Uncomment the annotations below.
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 10240m
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: 128k
    # 2. Comment out the empty annotations line.
    # annotations: {}
```

## Error: `nginx can not be set`

**Problem**
If after you run the `helm install` command, you see output that contains the error below, this is an indication that nginx is defined twice.

```
upgrade.go:442: [debug] warning: Upgrade "mostly-ai" failed: failed to create resource: Ingress.extensions "mostly-app" is invalid: annotations.kubernetes.io/ingress.class: Invalid value: "nginx": can not be set when the class field is also set
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: failed to create resource: Ingress.extensions "mostly-app" is invalid: annotations.kubernetes.io/ingress.class: Invalid value: "nginx": can not be set when the class field is also set
helm.go:84: [debug] Ingress.extensions "mostly-app" is invalid: annotations.kubernetes.io/ingress.class: Invalid value: "nginx": can not be set when the class field is also set
failed to create resource
```

**Solution**

1. Define NGINX only one time in `values.yaml`. Comment out the `ingressClassName` line.
    ```yaml filename="values.yaml" {2}
    ingress:
    # ingressClassName: nginx
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
2. Delete the `mostly-ai` namespace. This deletes all running MOSTLY AI pods and bound storage volumes.
    ```bash copy
    kubectl delete namespace mostly-ai
    ```
3. Redeploy MOSTLY AI.
    ```bash copy
    helm upgrade --install mostly-ai ./ --values values.yaml --namespace mostly-ai
    ```

## Error: `Subscription not registered to use 'Microsoft.Storage'`

**Problem**

If you did not register your Azure subscription to the `Microsoft.Storage` provider, the provisioning of storage volumes might show the following error:

```
The subscription is not registered to use namespace 'Microsoft.Storage'
```

**Solution**

1. Register your subscription to use the `Microsoft.Storage` service.
    ```bash copy
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Storage
    ```
2. Check the registration status.
    ```bash copy
    az provider show -n Microsoft.Storage --output table
    ```
    The output should be similar to the following:
    ```
    Namespace          RegistrationPolicy    RegistrationState
    -----------------  --------------------  -------------------
    Microsoft.Storage  RegistrationRequired  Registered
    ```
