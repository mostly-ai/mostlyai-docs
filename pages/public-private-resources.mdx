# Public and private resources

In MOSTLY AI, all resources are **private** upon creation.

You can make [Artifacts](/assistant/artifacts), [Generators](/generators), [Synthetic Datasets](/synthetic-datasets), [Datasets](/datasets) and [Connectors](/connectors) **public** to share with the world or you can keep them **private** for your own use.

You can also make Generators, Synthetic Datasets, Connectors, Datasets, and Chats **unlisted**. Unlisted resources are not visible in public resource lists or indexed by search engines, but anyone with the link can access them. This is a great way to share resources without making them overly easy to discover by happenstance.

<CustomCallout>

_Public resource lists_ include: - Generators list - Synthetic datasets list - Connectors list - User profiles - Organization profiles - Search results

</CustomCallout>

[Chats](/assistant) are always private by default but can be shared as unlisted resources.

The following rules apply to **public** resources:

- If you made a Generator, Synthetic Dataset, Dataset, or Connector public before transferring it to an organization, the resource remains public after the entity is transferred.
- Public resources, even those owned by organizations, are visible to everyone regardless of whether they are part of the organization or not.

**Steps**

1. With a Generator, Synthetic Dataset, Dataset, or Connector open, click **Share**.
