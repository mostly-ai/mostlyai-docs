# Public and private resources

<PrivateResourceIcon/>In MOSTLY AI, all resources (generators, synthetic datasets, connectors, assistant threads) are **private** immediately after you create them.

<PublicResourceIcon/>You can make [generators](/generators), [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets), and [connectors](/connectors) **public** to share with the world. Alternatively, you can keep them private for your internal use or that of your organization's.

<UnlistedResourceIcon/>You can also make generators, synthetic datasets, and connectors **unlisted**. Unlisted resources are not visible in public resource lists, but anyone with the link can access them.

<CustomCallout>
_Public resource lists_ include:
- Generators list
- Synthetic datasets list
- Connectors list
- User profiles
- Organization profiles
- Search results
</CustomCallout>

[Assistant threads](/assistant) are always private and cannot be made public. You can, however, [export an assistant thread as a Jupyter Notebook](/assistant/manage-threads#export-as-a-jupyter-notebook).

<Callout>
The following applies to **public resources**:

* If you made a generator, synthetic dataset, or connector public before transferring it to an organization, the resource will remain public after the transfer. It will be visible from the organization profile.
* Public resources are visible to everyone, including people who are not part of your organization.

**Steps**

1. With a generator, synthetic dataset, or connector open, click the kebab menu and select **Manage visibility**.

        alt="Manage visibility - 01 - Kebab menu"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
2. Select whether the resource should be made **Public**, **Private**, or **Unlisted**.
