# Public and private resources

In MOSTLY AI, all resources (generators, synthetic datasets, connectors, assistant threads) are private immediately after you create them. You can make [generators](/generators), [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets), and [connectors](/connectors) public to share with the world. Alternatively, you can keep them private for your internal use or that of your organization's.


[Assistant threads](/assistant) are always private and cannot be made public. You can, however, [export an assistant thread as a Jupyter Notebook](/assistant/manage-threads#export-as-a-jupyter-notebook).

<Callout>
The following applies to **public resources**:

* If you made a generator, synthetic dataset, or connector public before transferring it to an organization, the resource will remain public after the transfer. It will be visible from the organization profile.
* Public resources are visible to everyone, including people who are not part of your organization.

**Steps**

1. With a generator, synthetic dataset, or connector open, click the kebab menu and select **Manage visibility**.

    />
2. Select whether the resource should be made **Public** or **Private**.
