# Synthetic datasets

To generate synthetic data in MOSTLY AI, you start a new synthetic dataset. You can view all finished, canceled, failed, and in-progress synthetic datasets on the **Synthetic datasets** page.

## What is a synthetic dataset?

A synthetic dataset contains the generated (single- or multi-table) data as well as a number of additional artifacts.

- **Generated synthetic data** (available to download in CSV, Parquet, XLSX formats)
- **Usage statistics**
  - Generated data points
  - Credits used
- **Data insights**
  - Generator quality - Overall, Univariate, Bivariate, Coherence
  - Distances
  - Model report for the quality of the generator
  - Data report for the quality of the synthetic dataset
- **Data samples** - 10 generated samples from the generated data (that you can resample as needed)
- **Configuration**
  - JSON dictionary of the synthetic dataset configuration
  - Synthetic Data SDK code to access the synthetic data via Python or Jupyter Notebook

## Create a synthetic dataset

For more information, see [Generate single- and multi-table synthetic datasets](synthetic-datasets/generate).
