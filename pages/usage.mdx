# Usage and credits

The MOSTLY AI Platform at https://app.mostly.ai provides a daily limit of 5 credits to train generators, generate synthetic datasets, and use the Assistant. Enterprise deployments have a usage-based configuration which can be adjusted according to the organization's needs.

<CustomCallout>
**Note**
When you use up your credits, you can no longer train new generators, create new synthetic datasets, or start Assistant threads.

For more credits on https://app.mostly.ai or for the configuration of credits on Enterprise deployments, contact MOSTLY AI.
</CustomCallout>

## Usage

Usage is tracked based on consumed **Total CPU time** and **Total GPU time**.

For each generator and synthetic dataset, you will find the total virtual CPU/GPU time consumed in the **Training status** section.

## Check your credits usage

As you train generators and generate synthetic dataset, you can track the usage and the remaining credits you have on your account.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you use the web application, you can check your usage from the **Credits** status bar and tooltip in the upper right.

You can use the Python SDK `mostly.me()` primitive to check the usage on your account.
```python filename="python" copy
from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI
mostly = MostlyAI(api_key="INSERT_API_KEY")
mostly.me()
```
The result is a Python dictionary and you can find details about your current credits usage and limit in the `usage` key.

```python {6-11}
{
    'id': '132b0b2f-9310-422c-98bc-a7fdc5d59d29',
    'name': '***** ******',
    'email': '******@*******.com',
    'settings': {},
    'usage': {
        'credits': {
            'current': 1.662,
            'limit': 5.0,
            'period_start': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 18, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)),
            'period_end': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 18, 23, 59, 59, 999999, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC))
        },
        'parallel_training_jobs': {'current': 0, 'limit': 1},
        'parallel_generation_jobs': {'current': 0, 'limit': 1}
    }
}
```

## Monthly usage reports (Enterprise-only)

For organizations that use MOSTLY AI after deploying in their own private cloud environments, administrators can track their organization's monthly usage. The **Monthly reports** option is available only to Admin users.

If you are using the web application, you can track your organization's monthly usage statistics from your administrator profile menu.

**Steps**

1. Open the profile menu.
2. Select **Monthly reports**.

**Result**

The **Monthly reports** page displays the monthly usage statistics for your organization.

        alt="MOSTLY AI - Usage and credits - Monthly report"
        width={800}
        height={500}
    />

Each monthly report includes a monthly aggregation of the following metrics:

* generated rows
* generated data points <sup>[1](#^1)</sup>
* credits used

<sup><a name="^1">1</a></sup> _The **data points** metrics includes both data points generated in synthetic dataset as well as those generated by live probing generators._
