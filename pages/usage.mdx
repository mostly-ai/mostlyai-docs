# Usage and credits

The MOSTLY AI Platform at https://app.mostly.ai provides a daily limit of 5 credits to train generators, generate synthetic datasets, and use the Assistant. Enterprise deployments have a usage-based configuration which can be adjusted according to the organization's needs.

<CustomCallout>
**Note**
When you use up your credits, you can no longer train new generators, create new synthetic datasets, or start Assistant threads.

_Usage_ refers to the amount of **Virtual CPU time** and **Virtual GPU time** consumed.

## Virtual CPU and Virtual GPU time

MOSTLY AI measures the usage of the platform in terms of **Virtual CPU time** and **Virtual GPU time**.

## Usage examples

| Usage example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Training a generator on CPU** | The total amount of **virtual CPU time** spent to train the generator is counted as the usage incurred for this generator.  |
| **Fine-tuning an LLM on GPU** | The total amount of **virtual GPU time** spent to fine-tune an LLM.  |
| **Generating a synthetic dataset on CPU** | The total amount of **virtual CPU time** spent to generate the synthetic dataset. |
| **Using the Assistant to probe a generator on CPU** | The total amount of **virtual CPU time** spent to probe the generator with the Assistant. |

## Credits

Credits are the currency used to train generators, generate synthetic data, and use the Assistant.

```math
Credits = A x totalVirtualCPUTime + B x totalVirtualGPUTime
```

## How are 

## What is usage?

## Usage

Usage is tracked based on consumed **Total CPU time** and **Total GPU time**.

For each generator and synthetic dataset, you will find the total virtual CPU/GPU time consumed in the **Training status** section.

**Generator details: Compute consumption**
GPU and CPU time are measured in seconds. The total time is the sum of the GPU and CPU time used. GPU time is only available when a GPU was selected to train a generator.

**Synthetic dataset details: Compute consumption**
GPU time is only available when a GPU was selected to generate the synthetic dataset.

## Credits

Credits are consumed based on the total virtual CPU and GPU time used to train generators and generate synthetic datasets.

`Credits` = `ùê¥` √ó `Total Virtual CPU Time` + `ùêµ` √ó `Total Virtual GPU Time`, where `ùê¥` and `ùêµ`are the unit prices for CPU and GPU time respectively.

### Check your daily credits

As you train generators and generate synthetic dataset, you can track the usage and the remaining credits you have on your account.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you use the web application, you can check your usage from the **Credits** status bar and tooltip in the upper right.

You can use the Python SDK `mostly.me()` primitive to check the usage on your account.
```python filename="python" copy
from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI
mostly = MostlyAI(api_key="INSERT_API_KEY")
mostly.me()
```
The result is a Python dictionary and you can find details about your current credits usage and limit in the `usage` key.

```python {6-11}
{
    'id': '132b0b2f-9310-422c-98bc-a7fdc5d59d29',
    'name': '***** ******',
    'email': '******@*******.com',
    'settings': {},
    'usage': {
        'credits': {
            'current': 1.662,
            'limit': 5.0,
            'period_start': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 18, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)),
            'period_end': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 18, 23, 59, 59, 999999, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC))
        },
        'parallel_training_jobs': {'current': 0, 'limit': 1},
        'parallel_generation_jobs': {'current': 0, 'limit': 1}
    }
}
```

### Check your monthly credits

You can keep track of your monthly credits usage from the **Usage report** page.

**Steps**

From the profile menu, select **Usage report**.

**Result**

With **User: Me** selected from the drop-down menu, you can view the monthly usage statistics for your account.
