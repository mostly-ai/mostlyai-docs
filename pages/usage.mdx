# Usage and credits

The MOSTLY AI Platform at https://app.mostly.ai provides a daily limit of 5 credits to generate synthetic data points and use the Assistant. Enterprise deployments have a usage-based configuration which can be adjusted according to the organization's needs.

<CustomCallout>
**Note**
When you use up your credits, you can no longer train new generators or create new synthetic datasets.

For more credits on https://app.mostly.ai or for the configuration of credits on Enterprise deployments, contact MOSTLY AI.
</CustomCallout>

## Credits usage

With credits available, you can use the Assistant and generate synthetic data. The credits usage for both is slightly different. Learn how each impacts your credit balance.

### Credits usage for synthetic data

1 credit is worth the generation of 1 million synthetic data points. Synthetic data points include:

* single-cell values
* tokens in Text columns

Examples:

* a synthetic dataset that includes 10 columns and 5,000 rows is worth 50,000 synthetic data points. This equals 0.05 credits.
* if the synthetic dataset includes a Text column, the synthetic data points include the number of tokens in the Text column. Each token counts as 1 synthetic data point.

<CustomCallout>
To learn what a _**token**_ is, see [What are tokens and how to count them](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them) in the _OpenAI Help Center_. You can also use the [Tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) by OpenAI to see how a piece of text is tokenized and how many tokens it contains.
</CustomCallout>

### Credits usage for the Assistant

1 credit is worth 300,000 tokens when you use the Assistant. For each Assistant thread, you can track the number of tokens used in a thread.

    height={500}
/>

What is included in the number of tokens used:

* all messages sent by the user and replies generated by the Assistant
* the [system instructions](/assistant/configuration#system-instructions)
* any [custom system instructions](assistant/configuration#custom-instructions)
* the user's custom instructions

Also, every time you send a new message, the Assistant also receives all previous messages and responses to take into account (as context). This also counts towards the total number of tokens used.

### Check your credits usage

As you generate synthetic data, you can track the usage and the remaining credits you have on your account.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you use the web application, you can check your usage from the **Credits** status bar and tooltip in the upper right.

<Image
    src="/docs/docimages/usage/usage-credits-dropdown.webp"
    alt="Click Create connector button"
    width={800}
    height={500}
/>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
You can use the Python SDK `mostly.me()` primitive to check the usage on your account.
```python filename="python" copy
from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI
mostly = MostlyAI(api_key="INSERT_API_KEY")
mostly.me()
```
The result is a Python dictionary and you can find details about your current credits usage and limit in the `usage` key.

```python {6-11}
{
    'id': '132b0b2f-9310-422c-98bc-a7fdc5d59d29',
    'name': '***** ******',
    'email': '******@*******.com',
    'settings': {},
    'usage': {
        'credits': {
            'current': 1.662,
            'limit': 5.0,
            'period_start': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 18, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)),
            'period_end': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 18, 23, 59, 59, 999999, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC))
        },
        'parallel_training_jobs': {'current': 0, 'limit': 1},
        'parallel_generation_jobs': {'current': 0, 'limit': 1}
    }
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>

## Usage of generators, synthetic datasets, and connectors

You can track the usage of generators, synthetic datasets, and connectors in the MOSTLY AI web application and with the Python SDK.

### Usage of generators

For each generator, you can track the metrics below.

* **likes**
* **times used to generate a synthetic dataset**

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

If you use the web application, the **Generators** page contains an **Activity** column that shows the generator usage metrics.

<Image
    src="/docs/docimages/usage/generators-usage.webp"
    alt="MOSTLY AI - Usage and credits - Generators usage"
    width={800}
    height={500}
/>

The same metrics are also available when you open a generator.

<Image
    src="/docs/docimages/usage/generators-summary-usage.webp"
    alt="MOSTLY AI - Usage and credits - Generators usage"
    width={800}
    height={500}
/>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you use the Python SDK, you get metrics about generator usage with `g.usage`.

```python filename="python" copy
g = mostly.generators.get('INSERT_GENERATOR_ID')
g.usage
```
The result is an object with all metrics.
```python filename="python"
{
    'total_datapoints': 1287456,
    'total_compute_time': 176,
    'no_of_synthetic_datasets': 2,
    'no_of_likes': 2
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Usage of synthetic datasets

For each synthetic dataset, you can track how the number of **data points generated** and the number of **credits used**.
For each synthetic dataset, you can track the metrics below.

* **likes**
* **data points generated**
* **credits used**

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
In the web application, the metrics are available after you open a synthetic dataset.

<Image
    src="/docs/docimages/usage/synthetic-datasets-usage.webp"
    alt="MOSTLY AI - Usage and credits - Synthetic datasets usage"
    width={800}
    height={500}
/>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you use the Python SDK, you get metrics about generator usage with `sd.usage`.

```python filename="python" copy
sd = mostly.synthetic_datasets.get('INSERT_SYNTHETIC_DATASET_ID')
sd.usage
```
The result is an object with all metrics.
```python filename="python"
{
    'total_datapoints': 189129,
    'total_credits': 0.1891,
    'total_compute_time': 171,
    'no_of_likes': 1
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Usage of connectors

For each **source connector**, you can track _the number of generators using the connector as a data source_. For each **destination connector**, _the number of synthetic datasets delivered to the connector destination_ are available.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
In the web application, the **Connectors** page contains an **Activity** column that shows the connector usage metrics.

<Image
    src="/docs/docimages/usage/connectors-usage.webp"
    alt="MOSTLY AI - Usage and credits - Connectors usage"
    width={800}
    height={500}
/>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you use the Python SDK, you get metrics about connector usage with `c.usage`.

```python filename="python" copy
c = mostly.connectors.get('INSERT_CONNECTOR_ID')
c.usage
```
The result is the `ConnectorUsage` object which includes all metrics.
```python filename="python"
ConnectorUsage(
    no_of_generators=4
)
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Monthly usage reports (Enterprise-only)

For organizations that use MOSTLY AI after deploying in their own private cloud environments, administrators can track their organization's monthly usage. The **Monthly reports** option is available only to Admin users.

If you are using the web application, you can track your organization's monthly usage statistics from your administrator profile menu.

**Steps**

1. Open the profile menu.
2. Select **Monthly reports**.

**Result**

The **Monthly reports** page displays the monthly usage statistics for your organization.

    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/usage/monthly-report/monthly-report.webp"
        alt="MOSTLY AI - Usage and credits - Monthly report"
        width={800}
        height={500}
    />

Each monthly report includes a monthly aggregation of the following metrics:

* generated rows
* generated data points <sup>[1](#^1)</sup>
* credits used

<sup><a name="^1">1</a></sup> _The **data points** metrics includes both data points generated in synthetic dataset as well as those generated by live probing generators._
