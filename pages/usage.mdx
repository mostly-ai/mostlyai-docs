# Usage and credits

The [MOSTLY AI Platform](https://app.mostly.ai) provides a daily limit of 5 credits to train generators, generate synthetic datasets, and use the [Assistant](./assistant.mdx). Enterprise deployments have a usage-based configuration which can be adjusted according to the organization's needs.

<CustomCallout>
**Note**
When you use up your credits, you can no longer train new generators, create new synthetic datasets, or start chats.

For more credits or for the configuration of credits on Enterprise deployments, [contact MOSTLY AI](https://mostly.ai/contact).
</CustomCallout>

## Usage

Platform usage is tracked based on **Total CPU time**, **Total GPU time**, and **Token Consumption**.

For generators and synthetic datasets, you will find the virtual CPU/GPU time consumed in the **Training status** section. For chats, you will find the total token consumption as well as virtual CPU/GPU time consumed in the **Python Session status** section.

**Chat details: Compute and token consumption**
GPU and CPU time are measured in seconds while chat usage is measured in tokens. The total time is the sum of the GPU and CPU time used. GPU time is only available when a GPU was selected to train a generator. Token consumption is calculated at a rate of 1M tokens per 5.0 Credits.

**Generator details: Compute and token consumption**
GPU and CPU time are measured in seconds. The total time is the sum of the GPU and CPU time used. GPU time is only available when a GPU was selected to train a generator.

**Synthetic dataset details: Compute consumption**
GPU time is only available when a GPU was selected to generate the synthetic dataset.

## Credits

Credits are consumed based on the total virtual CPU and GPU time used to train generators and generate synthetic datasets. Credits are also be consumed during conversation with the Assistant at a rate of 5 credits per 1M tokens.

`Credits` = `ùê¥` √ó `Total Virtual CPU Time` + `ùêµ` √ó `Total Virtual GPU Time`, where `ùê¥` and `ùêµ`are the unit prices for CPU and GPU time respectively.

### Check your daily credits

As you train generators, generate synthetic datasets, and chat with the Assistant, you can track the usage and the remaining credits you have on your account.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you use the web application, you can check your usage from the **Credits** status bar and tooltip in the upper right.

You can use the Python SDK `mostly.me()` primitive to check the usage on your account.
```python filename="python" copy
from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI
mostly = MostlyAI(api_key="INSERT_API_KEY")
mostly.me()
```
The result is a Python dictionary and you can find details about your current credits usage and limit in the `usage` key.

```python {6-11}
{
    'id': '132b0b2f-9310-422c-98bc-a7fdc5d59d29',
    'name': '***** ******',
    'email': '******@*******.com',
    'settings': {},
    'usage': {
        'credits': {
            'current': 1.662,
            'limit': 5.0,
            'period_start': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 18, 0, 0, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC)),
            'period_end': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 18, 23, 59, 59, 999999, tzinfo=TzInfo(UTC))
        },
        'parallel_training_jobs': {'current': 0, 'limit': 1},
        'parallel_generation_jobs': {'current': 0, 'limit': 1}
    }
}
```

### Check your monthly credits

You can keep track of your monthly credits usage from the **Usage report** page.

**Steps**

From the profile menu, select **Usage report**.

**Result**

With **User: Me** selected from the drop-down menu, you can view the monthly usage statistics for your account.
