# Organizations

In MOSTLY AI, organizations provide a comfortable way for individuals and groups to publish synthetic data resources as well as for teams to collaborate on synthetic data projects.

üåé Establish organization profiles to **share synthetic data resources** ([_generators_](/generators), [_synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets), and [_connectors_](/connectors)) with the world or within your internal organization.<br />
üíø Use organizations to **manage synthetic data resources** and **access** to them.<br />
üì¢ Make resources **_public_** for anyone to access.<br />
üîê Keep them **_private_** and available only for team members to use.

The same features for organizations are available in the [MOSTLY AI Platform](https://app.mostly.ai) as well as when you [deploy the Platform in an internal cloud](/install/deploy).

An organization's profile is visible and accessible to all logged-in users of the Platform.
