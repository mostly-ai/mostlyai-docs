# Organizations

In MOSTLY AI, organizations allow individuals and groups to publish resources and collaborate on synthetic data projects.

Create an organization to share resources like [generators](/generators), [datasets](/datasets), [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets), and [connectors](/connectors) with the world or within your organization.<br />
- Make resources **_public_** for anyone to access.<br />
- Keep them **_private_** and available only for your team.

<CustomCallout>
The same features for organizations are available in the [MOSTLY AI Platform](https://app.mostly.ai) as well as when you [deploy the Platform in an internal cloud](/install/deploy).

An organization's profile is visible and accessible to all logged-in users of the Platform.
