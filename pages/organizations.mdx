# Organizations

In MOSTLY AI, organizations provide a comfortable way for organizations to publish synthetic data assets as well as for teams to collaborate on synthetic data projects.

🌎 Establish organization profiles to **share synthetic data assets** ([_generators_](/generators), [_synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets), and [_connectors_](/connectors)) with the world or within your internal organization.<br />
💿 Use organizations to **manage synthetic data assets** and **access** to them.<br />
📢 Make assets **_public_** for anyone to access.<br />
🔐 Keep them **_private_** and available only for team members to use.

The same organizations features are available in the [MOSTLY AI Platform](https://app.mostly.ai) as well as when you [deploy MOSTLY AI in your internal cloud](/install/deploy).

An organization profile is visible and accessible to all logged-in users of the Platform.
