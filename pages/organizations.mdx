# Organizations

In MOSTLY AI, organizations provide a comfortable way for organizations to publish synthetic data assets as well as for teams to collaborate on synthetic data projects.

üåé Establish organization profiles to **share synthetic data assets** ([_generators_](/generators), [_synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets), and [_connectors_](/connectors)) with the world or within your internal organization.<br />
üíø Use organizations to **manage synthetic data assets** and **access** to them.<br />
üì¢ Make assets **_public_** for anyone to access.<br />
üîê Keep them **_private_** and available only for team members to use.

<CustomCallout>
The same organizations features are available in the [MOSTLY AI Platform](https://app.mostly.ai) as well as when you [deploy MOSTLY AI in your internal cloud](/install/deploy).

An organization profile is visible and accessible to all logged-in users of the Platform.
</CustomCallout>




<CustomCallout>
[Assistant threads](/assistant) remain private for each user and cannot be shared within an organization. Assistant threads can be shared individually with other users of the MOSTLY AI Platform.

## Create an organization

<Tabs items={["UI", "Python SDK"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

**Steps**

1. From the sidebar, click **+ New organization**.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/create-01-sidebar-new-organization.webp"
        alt="Create a new organization"
        width={250}
        height={300}
    />
2. Set the organization display name.
    <CustomCallout>
    The **display name** appears on the organization profile page.

    The **organization name** is auto-generated from the display name. The rules below apply:
    
    * _lower-case letters only_
    * _hyphens replace white spaces_
    * _special characters are ommitted_
    * _leading, trailing, double-dashes are not allowed_
    </CustomCallout>
3. (Optional) If needed, tweak the organization name. Bear in mind the requirements listed above.
3. (Optional) Upload the organization logo.
    MOSTLY AI assigns one of 6 random logos to the organization if you do not upload one. You can always update that later.
