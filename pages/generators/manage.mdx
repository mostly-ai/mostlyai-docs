# Manage generators

To manage a generator, you need to be the owner or have Editor access to one.

## Status of generators

In the table below, you can find a list of all possible statuses a generator can have.

| Status               | Description                                                                                         | Next actions                                                                                                         |

## Clone a generator

If you need to reuse the data and model configuration from an existing generator, you can clone it. All previously added data as well as the model and training configuration are copied to the new generator.

Before you start, keep in mind:

* Cloning is available only for generators that use a database or a cloud storage connector as a data source.
* You cannot clone generators with uploaded files because the uploaded data is deleted after the generator training completes.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
Clone a generator from the Web UI, by following the steps below.

**Steps**

* Clone a generator directly from the **Generators** page.
    1. From the **Generators** page, click the kebab menu of a generator, and select **Clone**.
        <Image 
            src="/docs/docimages/generators/manage/clone-from-generators-page.webp" 
            alt="MOSTLY AI - Clone a generator - 01 - From Generators page, kebab menu, Clone" 
            width={800} 
            height={150}
        />
* Clone a generator after you open it.
    1. From the **Generators** page, click a generator to open it.
    2. Click the kebab menu in the upper right, and select **Clone**.
        <Image 
            src="/docs/docimages/generators/manage/clone-from-generator-details.webp" 
            alt="MOSTLY AI - Clone a generator - 02 - From Generators details page, kebab menu, Clone" 
            width={800} 
            height={150}
        />

**Result**

A new generator is created. The generator name starts with **Clone -** and is then followed by the name of the original generator.

    src="/docs/docimages/generators/manage/cloned-generator-result-name.webp" 
    alt="MOSTLY AI - Clone a generator - 03 - Name and result"
    width={800} 
    height={150}
/>

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
To clone a generator with the Python SDK, use the `clone()` method on a generator that has completed its training and set the `training_status` parameter to `NEW`. This reuses the existing generator configuration and prepares the cloned generator to train from scratch.

```python filename="python" copy
g = mostly.generators.get("INSERT_GENERATOR_ID_TO_CLONE")
cloned_g = g.clone(training_status="NEW") # clone the generator by reusing its data and model configuration and prepare for a new training
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

**What's next**

You can now reuse the data and model configuration from the previous generator and make any necessary changes before starting its training.

## Continue training

There may be cases where you need to improve the quality of a generator by resuming its training from the current weights of the model. An example is improving the overall accuracy of the generator. In such cases, you can use the **Continue training** option.

**Prerequisites**

* The generator you want to improve must have already completed training successfully. You cannot improve generators with **Failed** status.
* You can only improve generators that use a [database](/connectors/create#database-connectors) or a [cloud storage bucket](connectors/create#cloud-storage-connectors) as a data source. Due to the fact that uploaded files are deleted immediately after training, you cannot continue the training of such generators.
* The source data must be available for in the data source.
* You must have the Editor role.

You can continue the training of a generator from the Web UI and with the Python SDK.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>

To continue the training of a generator from the Web UI, follow these steps.

**Steps**

1. Continue the training of a generator in one of two ways.
    * From the **Generators** page, click the kebab menu of a generator, and select **Clone**.
        <Image 
            src="/docs/docimages/generators/manage/continue-training-01-generators-page-kebab-menu.webp" 
            alt="MOSTLY AI - Continue training - 02 - From Generators page, kebab menu, Continue training" 
            width={800} 
            height={150}
        />
    * With a generator open, click the kebab menu in the upper right, and select **Clone**.
        <Image 
            src="/docs/docimages/generators/manage/continue-training-02-opened-generator.webp" 
            alt="MOSTLY AI - Continue training - 02 - From Generators details page, kebab menu, Continue training" 
            width={800} 
            height={150}
        />
    **Step result**: The generator is cloned with the status `CONTINUE` and you can now configure the model and training options. Its name begins with **Continue training -** followed by the name of the original generator.
2. (Optional) Click a table to expand its model and training options and adjust as needed.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/generators/manage/continue-training-03-configure-model-training.webp"
        alt="MOSTLY AI - Continue training - 03 - Configure model and training options"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
3. Click **Continue training** to continue the training of the generator.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/generators/manage/continue-training-04-click-continue-training.webp"
        alt="MOSTLY AI - Continue training - 04 - Click Continue training"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />

**Result**

MOSTLY AI fetches the original data from the data source and continues the training from the already saved model weights.

<Image 
    src="/docs/docimages/generators/manage/continue-training-05-result.webp" 
    alt="MOSTLY AI - Continue training - 05 - Result"
    width={800} 
    height={150}
/>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
To continue the training of a generator with the Python SDK, use the `clone()` method on a generator that has completed its training and set the `training_status` parameter set to `CONTINUE`.
```python filename="python" copy
g = mostly.generators.get("INSERT_GENERATOR_ID_TO_CONTINUE_TRAINING")
cloned_g = g.clone(training_status="CONTINUE") # clone the generator along with its saved model weights
cloned_g.training.start() # start the training of the new cloned_g generator
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

**What's next**

You can use the newly trained generator to [generate a new synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/generate) or [probe it](/generators/live-probing) for immediately generated samples.

## Transfer ownership

To learn how to transfer ownership in all supported scenarios, see [_Public and private resources_](/public-private-resources).

## Revoke access

If you no longer want a generator to be accessed by a user, you can revoke their access.

**Steps**

1. From the **Generators** page, select a generator.
2. Click **Share** in the upper right.
3. From the access menu, select **Remove access**.

**Result**

The user is now removed from the list of people who can access this generator.

## Delete a generator

A generator contains Generative AI models, one for each table of data. Depending on the size of your original data, it can take a long time to train a new one.

If you need to delete a generator, you can do so after you open a generator.

**Steps**

1. From the **Generators** page, select a generator.
2. Click the kebab menu in the upper right.
3. Select **Delete**.
4. Click **Yes** in the confirmation dialog.

**Result**

The generator is now deleted.
