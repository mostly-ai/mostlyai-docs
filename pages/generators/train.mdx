# Train a new generator

With generators, MOSTLY AI makes it easy to use Generative AI to train your own AI models on single- and multi-table datasets. You can then use a trained generator to generate endless amounts of high-quality and privacy-protected synthetic data.

You can quickly train a new generator with a single tabular data file.

<CustomCallout>You can also train generators with two-table and multi-table datasets. For more information, see [Set table relationships](/generators/configure/set-table-relationships).</CustomCallout>

1. On the MOSTLY AI platform, open **Generators** from the left-side navigation menu.
2. There are four ways to create a new generator:

| Method                 | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start from a connector | Use an existing [connector](/connectors) to train a new generator.                        |
| Upload your data       | Provide a CSV, Parquet, or TSV file to train a new generator from your local file system. |
| Use the SDK            | Navigate to the [Synthetic Data SDK](/python-sdk) repository.                             |
| Import a generator     | Upload a [configured generator](/generators/export-import#export-a-generator) file.       |

3. After selecting your training method and uploading any required files, click **Configure models**.
4. Each connected or uploaded table supports its own configuration. Expand each table description to customize model behavior.

| Method               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model                | The model your generator uses to create synthetic data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Compute              | The [compute resources](/administration/compute) used to train the generator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Training parameters  | The model-level parameters which control the training process. Each parameter is defined by a tooltip in the platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Differential privacy | Use differential privacy when you need a mathematical guarantee of privacy, with epsilon quantifying the upper bound on an individual's impact on the trained model.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Flexible generation  | Enabled by default, flexible generation gives you the option to apply smart imputation, data rebalancing, seeded generation and apply fairness when you generate synthetic datasets with the model.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Value protection     | Value protection prevents membership inference by replacing rare categories and removing extreme values from your dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Model report         | Enabled by default, the Model report provides metrics and charts to gauge the quality of a model. The calculated metrics and charts include accuracy, similarity, and distances between original and synthetic samples, and the correlations, univariate, and bivariate distribution charts to compare the original and synthetic correlations and distributions. |

<Callout>MOSTLY AI offers three training Presets in the **Model configuration** section header if you don't want to configure individual parameters: **Accuracy**, **Speed**, and **Turbo**.</Callout>

5. In the **Model configuration** section header, you can optionally configure **Random State** which is a seed value to ensure reproducible results during training. If left empty, a random seed will be used each time.
6. After completing configuration, click **Start training** to begin the training process.

Follow progress in the **Training status** section on the generator page.

1. Start a new chat with the Assistant by clicking **New chat** in the left-side navigation menu.
2. Prompt the Assistant to connect to a configured [dataset](/datasets) or upload a dataset file into the Assistant workspace.

```bash
Connect to the Berka dataset and briefly describe this resource.
```

3. Prompt the Assistant to create a generator with the defined resource.

```bash
Configure a generator that will produce data which follows the statistical patterns of the least active accounts in the dataset.
```

1. [Install the MOSTLY AI Synthetic Data SDK](/python-sdk#installation).<br /><br />
   You can install and use the SDK in **Local** or **Client** mode.

   - In **Local mode**, you use the SDK with the compute resources on your local machine (or any Python environment) to [train generators](/generators/train) and [create synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets/generate).
   - In **Client mode**, you connect to a remote MOSTLY AI Platform instance and use its available compute resources.
     For details, see [_Local and Client modes_](/python-sdk#local-and-client-modes).<br /><br />

2. Create your first generator using the [US Census Income](/datasets#us-census-income-dataset) dataset, start its training, and wait for it to finish.

```python copy filename="python" {7} # 1. Load original data into a pd.DataFrame
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("https://docs.mostly.ai/public-datasets/us-census-income.csv.gz")

# 2. Instantiate in Local use
from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI
mostly = MostlyAI(local=True)

# 3. Create a generator and launch its training
g = mostly.train(data=df, start=True, wait=True)
```

# 2. Instantiate in Client mode by connecting to a remote Platform instance
from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI
