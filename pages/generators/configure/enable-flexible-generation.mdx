title: "Flexible generation"
description: "Generators in MOSTLY AI have flexible generation on by default. You can use such generators to rebalance your synthetic datasets, use data imputation to replace missing or null values with statistically reliable ones, and generate fair synthetic data."

# Flexible generation

Before you start the training of a generator, you can configure whether it will have **Flexible generation** turned on or off.

| Flexible generation status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled **Flexible generation** | Uses the **Any order** model of feeding original columns for training that is randomly permuted for every batch.<br /><br />With **Flexible generation** enabled, you can use the generator to:<br /><br />  • [rebalance data](/synthetic-datasets/rebalance-columns)<br />  • [impute data](/synthetic-datasets/data-imputation)<br />  • [use fairness](/synthetic-datasets/fairness)<br />  • [generate synthetic data conditionally based on a seed dataset](/synthetic-datasets/seeded-generation)<br /><br />➡️ Flexible generation can lead to a reduced accuracy. Most impacted are models trained on particularly wide tables. |
| Disabled **Flexible generation** | Uses the **Fixed order** model of feeding original columns in the same order in which they appear in the original data.<br /><br />➡️ With the **Fixed order** model, you can achieve maximum accuracy of the trained generator. |

## Set flexible generation

Flexible generation is on by default for each table in a generator. You can keep it on or turn it of depending on whether you intend to use the generator to rebalance data, or any of the flexible generation scenarios listed above.

If you use the web application, you can configure flexible generation from the **Model configuration** page of a generator.

**Steps**

1. With an untrained generator open, click **Configure models**.
2. Click a table to open its model configuration.
3. Expand **Flexible generation**.
3. Select **On** or **Off** depending on how you want to train this AI model.

For the Pyhon client, use the `enable_flexible_generation` key in the `tabular_model_configuration` dictionary and set to `True` to enable. Use `False` to disable.
