# Configure AI models for time-series and events data

MOSTLY AI supports specific AI models for training on time-series. You can configure how these models train on your time-series data.

## Use Datetime and Datetime: relative column types

For any datetime columns in your data (that are in a supported format), MOSTLY AI assigns the [**Datetime** column type](/generators/configure/set-encoding-types#datetime). You can also use the [**Datetime: relative** column type](/generators/configure/set-encoding-types#datetime-relative).

If you prioritize having valid and statistically representative dates and times, use **Datetime**. If you want to generate accurate intervals between each event where accurate dates are not a priority, use **Datetime: relative**.

## Maintain correlations and referential integrity with related tables

Tables containing time-series and events data usually reference **subject tables** that include PII information about people, organizations, and other entities. In MOSTLY AI, time-series and events tables are recognized as **linked tables**. To ensure that your generator learns the correlations between events and subjects and maintains the referential integrity between such tables, you should create a **context relationship** between subject and linked tables when you configure your generator.

For more information, see [Context and non-context relationships](/generators/configure/set-table-relationships/multi-table#context-and-non-context-relationships) and [Context foreign key](/generators/configure/set-table-relationships#context-foreign-key).

## Set max sequence window

**Max sequence window** applies only to linked tables (with time-series and events data) and Text models. A linked table has a [context foreign key](/generators/configure/set-table-relationships#context-foreign-key) to another table.

For linked tables, the term **_sequence_** means the events that belong to a single subject. The term **_sequence length_** indicates the number of events in the sequence. For example, if subject A has 30 related events, then the sequence length is 30.

MOSTLY AI has a specific AI model for time-series and events data that captures the sequences and event patterns in linked tables. While performing AI model training on a complete sequence can lead to high accuracy, this can also lead to out-of-memory failures if certain sequences are too long. For better training efficiency, you can adjust the **Max sequence window** training parameter. This sets the maximum subsequence of events the model trains on for the duration of a training epoch. During each epoch, the window shifts to consider a different subsequence with the goal to train on the entire sequence by the end of model training.

By default, **Max sequence window** is set to 100.

If you use the web application, you can configure the maximum sequence window from the **Model configuration** page of a generator.

**Steps**

1. With an untrained generator open, go to the **Model configuration** page by clicking **Configure models**.
2. Click a linked table to expand its model settings.
3. Adjust the **Max sequence window**.

For the Python SDK, set the `max_sequence_window` key in the `tabular_model_configuration` dictionary.

```python filename="python" copy {13}
config = {
   "name": "baseball",
   "tables": [
      {
         "name": "players",
         "data": "https://github.com/mostly-ai/public-demo-data/raw/dev/baseball/players.csv.gz",
         "primary_key": "id",
      },
      {
         "name": "batting",
         "data": "https://github.com/mostly-ai/public-demo-data/raw/dev/baseball/batting.csv.gz",
         "tabular_model_configuration": {
            "max_sequence_window": 20,
         },
         "foreign_keys": [
            { "column": "players_id", "referenced_table": "players", "is_context": True }
         ],
      }
   ]
}
```
