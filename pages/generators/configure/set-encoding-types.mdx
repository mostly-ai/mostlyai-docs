# Set encoding types

When you add your original table data to a generator, MOSTLY AI assigns an encoding type to each column. The assignment depends on the _**data inside the columns**_ (for file uploads and cloud storage files) or on the _**data types defined in the database schema**_ (for database data sources).

## About encoding types

The _**encoding type**_ defines how your original data is encoded before AI model training. This is a requirement for the training phase, when the data needs to be in a format that can be processed for the purposes of machine learning.

As a best practice, check the auto-detected encoding types and, if needed, select an encoding type that is a better match for your data.

## Set the encoding type of a column

When you add a table to a generator in the web application, MOSTLY AI analyzes the data in each column and auto-assigns the best possible encoding type. You can always select a different encoding type.

With the Python SDK, you do not need to specify an encoding type when you submit a new generator configuration for training. MOSTLY AI will again analyze each column and assign the best possible encoding type. You can still use the `model_encoding_type` key to enforce an encoding type.

        alt="MOSTLY AI - Generator - Set column types - Select type"
        width={900}
        height={300}
    />
3. Set a column type that best describes the data in the column.

For more information about each type, see the sections below.
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
To set encoding types with the Python SDK, use the `table.columns` dictionary as shown in the example below. For each column in your source data, define the column with a `name` and set the encoding type with the `model_encoding_type` key.

```python copy {7-16}
config = {
   "name": "us-census-income",
   "tables": [
      {
         "name": "us-census-income",
         "data": "https://mostly.ai/docs/datasets/us-census-income.csv.gz",
         "columns": [
            {
               "name": "age",
               "model_encoding_type": "TABULAR_NUMERIC_DISCRETE"
            },
            {
               "name": "income",
               "model_encoding_type": "TABULAR_CATEGORICAL"
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}

g = mostly.train(config = config, start=True, wait=True)
```

For a column, the `model_encoding_type` key accepts one of the values listed below.

| Encoding type               | Description                                                                       |

## Encoding types

When you select an encoding type, you also [select the model to train or fine-tune](#models). MOSTLY AI supports tabular and language models.

[**Tabular models**](#tabular-models). Tabular models train on original tabular data to then generate privacy-preserving **tabular synthetic data**. Their encoding types are prefixed with **Tabular/** (in the Platform UI) or `TABULAR_` (for the Python SDK). MOSTLY AI supports three tabular model sizes.

The list of tabular models includes:
   * [MOSTLY AI/Small](#mostly-aismall)
   * [MOSTLY AI/Medium](#mostly-aimedium)
   * [MOSTLY AI/Large](#mostly-ailarge)
      <Callout>
      Selecting a model size is part of the _speed vs accuracy_ trade-off when training a generator. For details, see [_Increase model size_](/generators/configure/improve-model-accuracy#increase-model-size) and [_Select a smaller model_](/generators/configure/speed-up-training#select-a-smaller-model).
      </Callout>
[**Language models**](#language-models). With language models, you can generate privacy-preserving **synthetic text data**. Encoding types for language models are prefixed with **Language/** (when using the Platform UI) or `LANGUAGE_` (when using the Python SDK). To learn more about the supported use cases, check out each Language encoding type.

The list of language models includes:
   * [MOSTLY_AI/LSTMFromScratch-3m](#mostly_ailstmfromscratch-3m)
   * [HuggingFace LLMs](#huggingface-llms)

### Tabular

Tabular encoding types include support for multiple data types, such as categorical, numeric, datetime, and geolocation data.

#### Categorical

A categorical variable has a fixed set of possible values that are already present in the input data. An example of such a variable is T-shirt size, which could consist of the following categories: 'XS, S, M, L, XL'. The synthetic data will only contain categories that were present in the original data. Categorical variables thus prevent random values (for instance, 'XM, A, B') from appearing in your synthetic dataset.

If the automatic encoding type detection does not recognize a **Numeric** or **Datetime** column as such, it is encoded as **Categorical**.

You can control how the rare category protection mechanism works with **Value protection** settings and the **Rare category replacement method** which appear on the **Model configuration** page of a generator. These settings help with protecting rare categories. Rare categories may cause re-identification of outliers among your data subjects if theyâ€™re present in the resulting synthetic data.

There are two rare category protection methods available with which you can mask these categories:

**Constant**<br />
Replaces rare categories with the value `_RARE_`.

<Callout type="info">
The use of **Constant** introduces the `_RARE`_ category in your synthetic data and that can impact your downstream tasks. To avoid that, you can use the **Sample** method.
</Callout>

**Sample**<br />
Replaces rare categories with categories that will appear in the synthetic version of this column. The categories are sampled from the original data based on their frequency. The more frequent a category is, the more likely it will be selected.

#### Numeric: Auto

With **Numeric: Auto**, MOSTLY AI uses heuristics to decide the most appropriate **Numeric** encoding type based on the data in a column. For most cases, select **Numeric:Auto** or leave it selected by default.

#### Numeric: Discrete

**Discrete** treats the numeric data in the column as categorical values. You can use this option for columns that have categorical numeric codes, such as:
  * ZIP codes, postal codes, country phone codes
  * binary `True` or `False` that are represented as the numeric values `0` and `1`
  * any categorical data which are represented with numeric values

**Rare category protection** also applies to **Numeric: Discrete** columns. When you generate a synthetic dataset, MOSTLY AI replaces rare numeric categories with a non-rare numeric category in the column (applying the **Sample** method as explained above for Categorical columns). `_RARE_` values are not generated for **Numeric: Discrete** columns.

#### Numeric: Binned

You can use **Binned** for columns containing large integers or long decimals. MOSTLY AI bins the numerical values into 100 bins and considers each a category during training. During generation, MOSTLY AI samples values from the corresponding bin to generate the synthetic values in the column.

#### Numeric: Digit

**Numeric: Digit** recognizes the data in the column as numeric values.

<Callout type="info">
MOSTLY AI can synthesize floating-point values with a precision of up to 8 digits after the decimal point.
</Callout>

#### Character

Use the **Character** encoding type to synthesize short strings with a consistent pattern, such as phone numbers, license plate numbers, company IDâ€™s, transaction ID, and social security IDâ€™s.

#### Datetime

Datetime refers to values that contain a date part and a time part. This encoding type enables MOSTLY AI to synthesize them and generate valid and statistically representative dates and times.

The following formats are supported:

| | Format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Date** | `yyyy-MM-dd` | `2020-02-08` |
| **Datetime with hours** | `yyyy-MM-dd HH`<br />`yyyy-MM-ddTHH`<br />`yyyy-MM-ddTHHZ` | `2020-02-08 09`<br />`2020-02-08T09`<br />`2020-02-08T09Z` |
| **Datetime with minutes** | `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`<br />`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm`<br />`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmZ` | `2020-02-08 09:30`<br />`2020-02-08T09:30`<br />`2020-02-08T09:30Z` |
| **Datetime with seconds** | `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`<br />`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss`<br />`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ` | `2020-02-08 09:30:26`<br />`2020-02-08T09:30:26`<br />`2020-02-08T09:30:26Z` |
| **Datetime with milliseconds** | `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS`<br />`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS`<br />`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ` | `2020-02-08 09:30:26.123`<br />`2020-02-08T09:30:26.123`<br />`2020-02-08T09:30:26.123Z` |

#### Datetime: Relative

**Datetime: Relative** models the time interval between two subsequent events in the synthetic dataset. This encoding type causes the time between events to become very accurate, but the dates become less accurate.

<Callout type="info">
The **Datetime: Relative** encoding type is only available for linked tables.
</Callout>

#### Latitude, Longitude

Use the **Latitude, Longitude** encoding type to synthesize geolocation coordinates.

MOSTLY AI requires a geolocation coordinate to be encoded in a single field with the latitude and longitude as comma-separated values. The latitude must be on the commaâ€™s left side and the longitude on the right.

The values must be in decimal degrees format and range from `-90` to `90` for latitude and `-180` to `180` for longitude. Their precision cannot be larger than five digits after the decimal dot. This translates to an accuracy of approx. 1 meter. Any additional digits will be ignored.

| Start location | End location | Some other location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `70.31311, 150.1` | `-90.0, 180.0` | `37.311, 173.8998` |
| `-39.0, 120.33114` | `78.31112, -100.031` | `-10.10, -80.901` |

<Callout type="info">
For CSV files, wrap each coordinate in double quotes.
To learn more, see [CSV files requirements](/generators/prepare-data/csv-requirements).
</Callout>

### Language

Use **Language** encoding types for the following use cases:

* fine-tune LLMs with tabular categorical, numeric, and datetime data
* fine-tune LLMs with original unstructured text data to then generate synthetic text data
* train on short text data to later generate privacy-preserving names, emails, and others

#### Categorical

Use the **Language/Categorical** encoding type to fine-tune an LLM with the categorical data in the selected column.

When you [generate a synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/generate), you leverage the LLM pre-training and knowledge in the use cases listed below.

* Generate representative categories even when fine-tuning with smaller datasets
* Apply [conditional generation by seeding](/synthetic-datasets/seeded-generation) numeric values that weren't present in the original data

#### Numeric

Use the **Language/Numeric** encoding type to fine-tune an LLM with the numeric data in the selected column.

<CustomCallout>
Use cases for LLM-generated numeric data are the same as the ones listed in [**Language/Categorical**](#languagecategorical).
</CustomCallout>

#### Datetime

Use the **Language/Categorical** encoding type to fine-tune an LLM with the numeric data in the selected column.

<CustomCallout>
Use cases for LLM-generated datetime data are the same as the ones listed in [**Language/Categorical**](#languagecategorical).
</CustomCallout>

#### Text

With the **Language/Text** encoding type, you have two general choices:

* train the not pre-trained [MOSTLY AI/LSTM](#mostly_ailstmfromscratch-3m) model with unstructured text to be able to generate unstructured natural language texts up to 1,000 characters
* fine-tune a [HuggingFace LLM](https://huggingface.co/) with original unstructured language texts of any length to generate unstructured synthetic text data

## Models

MOSTLY AI supports the following models for generating tabular synthetic data and unstructured synthetic text.

### Tabular

For tabular data, you can train tabular models of three different sizes, depending on the trade-off between speed and accuracy.

#### MOSTLY AI/Small

The **MOSTLY AI/Small** tabular model uses fewer parameters, takes less memory and time, at the cost of accuracy

#### MOSTLY AI/Medium

The **MOSTLY AI/Medium** tabular model uses an optimal amount of parameters and is best for most use cases.

#### MOSTLY AI/Large

The **MOSTLY AI/Large** tabular model maximizes accuracy with more parameters but requires extra memory and time to complete training.

### Language

For unstructured text data, you can:

* train the not pre-trained [MOSTLY AI/LSTM](#mostly_ailstmfromscratch-3m)
* fine-tune a [HuggingFace LLM](https://huggingface.co/)

#### MOSTLY AI/LSTMFromScratch-3m

The **LSTM** is not a pre-trained model and you can use it to synthesize unstructured natural language texts up to 1,000 characters.

You can use this encoding type to generate realistic, representative, and anonymous financial transaction texts, short user feedback, medical assessments, PII fields, etc. As the resulting synthetic texts are representative of the terms, tokens, and their co-occurrence in the original data, they can be confidently used in analytics and machine learning use cases, such as sentiment analysis and named-entity recognition. Even though they might look noisy and not very human-readable, they will work perfectly for these use cases.

Our text synthesis model is language-agnostic and doesnâ€™t contain the biases of some pre-trained modelsâ€”any content is solely learned from the original training data. This means that it can process any language, vernacular, and slang present in the original data.

The amount of data required to produce usable results depends on the diversity of the original texts' vocabulary, categories, names, etc. As a rule of thumb, the more structure there is, the fewer samples are needed.

The synthetic texts are generated in a context-aware mannerâ€”the messages from a teenager are different from those of an 85-year old grandmother, for instance. By considering the other attributes of a synthetic subjectâ€™s profile, MOSTLY AI is capable of synthesizing appropriate natural language texts for each of them.

Below, you can find two examples. The first example demonstrates MOSTLY AIâ€™s ability to synthesize entirely new names from a multilingual dataset. And the second example shows the result of synthesizing Tripadvisor reviews. Here you can see that the resulting texts accurately retain the context of the establishment they discuss (Restaurant or Hotel) and the synthesized rating.
