# Add data to a generator

While a generator has the **New** status, indicating that it has been created but not trained, you can add additional data to the source dataset.

You can add data from multiple sources:

- File upload (CSV, Parquet)
- Databases
- Cloud storage buckets

<CustomCallout>**Note** You cannot add data to generators that have already been trained unless you [continue generator training](../manage).</CustomCallout>

Open an untrained generator from the **Generators** page or create a new one to add additional data to the source dataset.

**Steps**

1. From the **Data configuration** page of an untrained generator, click **Add table**. The **Select data source** modal appears.
2. You can either **Upload a file** or **Connect to source**.
   - If you choose to upload a file, select one from the local file system.
   - If you choose to connect to a source, select a connector from the list of configured connectors.
3. (Optional) You can change the default table name if you wish to do so, by defaultMOSTLY AI captures the table name from the file provided.
4. Click **Proceed**.

**Result**

The additional data is added to the source dataset and MOSTLY AI uses it during generator training.
