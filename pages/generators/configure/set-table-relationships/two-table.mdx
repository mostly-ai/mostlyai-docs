# Two-table relationship

The two-table scenario includes a **_subject table_** and a **_linked table_**. _Subject tables_ contain PII details about people, companies, or any other entities. _Linked tables_ contain time-series or events data, one or many of which belong to a subject.

For example, the figure below shows the `customers` and `purchases` tables from the [CDNOW dataset](/datasets#cdnow-dataset). The highlighted rows show the relationship between subject records from the `customers` table and their related events records from the `purchases` table.

To train a generator on a two-table dataset, you need to define the foreign key from the `purchases` table that points to the primary key to the `users` table.

If you use the web interface, add both tables to the generator and set their relationship.

**Steps**

1. In MOSTLY AI, select **Generators** from the top menu.
2. On the **Generators** page, click **+ New generator**.
    <Image

        alt="MOSTLY AI - Generators page - Click New generator"
        width={800}
        height={300}
    />
3. Upload the `customers` table.
    1. Click **Upload file**.
        <Image
            src="/docs/docimages/generators/train/02-select-upload-file.webp"
            alt="MOSTLY AI - Generators page - Select Upload file"
            width={800}
            height={300}
        />
    2. Upload the `customers` table, leave its name as `customers`, and click **Proceed**.<br />
        **Step result**: The table is now added to the generator.

            width={800}
            height={300}
        />
5. Upload the `purchases` table.
    1. In the generator, click **Add data**.
        <Image
            src="/docs/docimages/generators/set-table-relationships/table-rel-02-click-add-data.webp"
            alt="MOSTLY AI - Click Add data"
            width={800}
            height={300}
        />
    2. Click **Upload files**, upload the table, leave its name as `purchases`, and click **Proceed**.<br />
        **Step result**: The table is now added to the generator.
6. Set the relationship between the `customers` and `purchases` tables.
    1. Hover over the linked table (in this case `purchases`) and click **Edit foreign keys**.
        <Image
            src="/docs/docimages/generators/set-table-relationships/table-rel-03-click-edit-foreign-keys.webp"
            alt="MOSTLY AI - Click Edit foreign keys"
            width={800}
            height={300}
        />
    2. In the drawer, click **Add foreign key**.
    3. For **Foreign key**, select the foreign key column for the `purchases` table. In this case, the `users_id` column.
    4. For **Referenced table**, select the table to which the foreign key points to. In this case, the `customers` table.
    5. For **Referenced primary key**, select the primary key column of the referenced table. In this case, the `id` column.
    6. Select the **Is context** checkbox.
    7. Click the confirmation button.
        <Image
            src="/docs/docimages/generators/set-table-relationships/table-rel-04-configure-foreign-key.webp"
            alt="MOSTLY AI - Click Edit foreign keys"
            width={800}
            height={300}
        />
7. Click **Close** in the upper right to close the drawer.

**Result**

The two-table relationship foreign key is now set. The linked table `purchases` is now nested and indented under its subject table `customers`.

With the context relationship defined, the generator can capture the correlations and retain the referential integrity between the two tables during AI model training.

Optionally, you can click **Relationship diagram** to get an overview of all table relationships.

**What's next**

You can now train the generator on the CDNOW dataset with the default options. To do so, click **Configure models** and then **Start training**.

With the Python SDK, define each table as a dictionary in the `tables` list and include the `primary_key` and the `foreign_keys` keys for the subject and linked table. It is important to set `is_context: True{:python}` for the foreign key. For more information, see [Context foreign key](../set-table-relationships#context-foreign-key).
```python filename="python" copy {15,20}
# load data
import pandas as pd
cdnow_url = "https://github.com/mostly-ai/public-demo-data/raw/dev/cdnow/"
users_df = pd.read_csv(cdnow_url + "users.csv.gz")
purchases_df = pd.read_csv(cdnow_url + "purchases.csv.gz")
