## Manage primary keys

When you set a foreign key to another table, you need to specify the primary key of the referenced table. This is required to create the table relationship. This also automatically sets a primary key if the referenced table did not already have one.

If necessary, you can manually set and remove primary keys for each table in a generator.

### Set a primary key

You can set the primary key for any table regardless of the synthetic data use case (single-table, two-table, or multi-table).

**Steps**

1. On the **Data configuration** page, click the **Primary key** drop-down for a table.

        width={900}
        height={300}
    />
2. Select the primary key column for the table.
3. (Optional) Repeat for all tables.

### Remove a primary key

To remove a primary key, hover over a table in the **Primary key** column and click the <RemovePrimaryKey/> button.

/>

If a foreign key references the primary key you want to remove, you will get a warning that this will break the existing relationship.
