# What's new in MOSTLY AI

## v4.9.0

_July 11th, 2025_

### Datasets available in public API

Adds Datasets as a new resource type, allowing users to upload files directly via [API](https://api-docs.mostly.ai). Datasets are discrete collections of data created by a generator, uploaded to the platform directly, or accessed via connector.

### Resource usage tracking for popularity sort

Tracks how often resources like [generators](./generators.mdx), [synthetic datasets](./synthetic-datasets.mdx), and [connectors](./connectors.mdx) are used across chats. When a resource is shown in an [Assistant](./assistant.mdx) message, its usage is recorded; if the resource or chat is deleted, the corresponding usage entry is removed. Resources can now be sorted number of uses value on the platform.

### New homepage design

MOSTLY AI is a data intelligence platform for everyone. Our new homepage reflects that mission by offering users the ability to launch any task directly from the platform homepage. Leverage the [Assistant](./assistant.mdx) to create a new [dataset](./synthetic-datasets.mdx), build a [generator](./generator.mdx), or configure a new [connector](./connectors.mdx) using [natural language prompts](./assistant/prompt-examples.mdx).

### Improvements

- {/* MSD-1877 */} Platform: New sidebar menu with list of chats

### Resolved issues

- {/* MSD-1892 */} Real-time credit updates for chat usage

### Upstream dependencies

- Upgraded to [`mostlyai`](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostlyai) 4.8.3, [`mostlyai-engine`](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostlyai-engine) 1.4.8, [`mostlyai-mock`](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostlyai-mock) 0.1.14

## v4.8.3

_July 3rd, 2025_

### Enhance resource sharing experience

Introduce a [unified **Share** feature](https://docs.mostly.ai/organizations/manage-resources/#transfer-a-resource-to-an-organization) that combines visibility settings and ownership transfer into one place, replacing the previous separate controls. Users can access this modal either by clicking the Share button or directly on the visibility badge, streamlining how sharing and access control are managed.

### Consider token usage for credit consumption

Chatting with the [Assistant](./assistant.mdx) is billed at a rate of 5.0 credits for every 1M tokens processed. This ensures [token usage](./usage.mdx) is factored into billing alongside computational resource consumption.

## v4.1.0

_Feb 5th, 2025_

### Organizations

{/* MSD-1152 */}
Introducing Organizations 🏢🌎📣

The team at MOSTLY AI has been hard at work to introduce Organizations for all users, teams, and organizations that want to collaborate on synthetic data projects. With Organizations, you can:

- establish an organization for your team to collaborate, contribute, and share synthetic data resources
- develop an organization's portfolio of synthetic data resources (generators, synthetic datasets, and connectors)
- use role-based access (RBAC) to manage the roles and permissions team members have with regard to synthetic data resources
- empower organizations to make synthetic data resources public by managing their visibility

For details, see [_Organizations_](/organizations).

### Public and private resources

{/* MSD-? */}

You can now change the visibility of your generators, synthetic datasets, and connectors (referred to as _resources_, for brevity).

- You can share resources with everyone on the Platform by making them **public**.
- You can keep resources **private** (their default state after a resource is created).
- Apply the same visibility settings to an organization's resources.

For details, see [_Public and private resources_](/public-private-resources)

- {/* MSD-787 */} The Assistant no longer shows `Unable to fetch` error for a dataframe that was not saved to a file.
- {/* MSD-934 */} To ensure that you can import generators created prior to v303, the compute is not listed in the **Training status** section when you import such generators.

## v303

_Sep 23rd, 2024_

### Distances (DCR) metric now uses 10% validation set as a true holdout

{/* MSD-910 */}
The **Distances** metric (_Distance to Closest Record_) now uses a 10% validation dataset as a true holdout. The true holdout is drawn completely randomly from the original dataset.

With this approach, the distances are now calculated between the synthetic samples and their closest neighbors from the training dataset (90% of the original dataset after the holdout split). For reference, you also have the distances between the synthetic samples and their closest neighbors from the holdout dataset. You can then use both distances calculations to gauge that the synthetic samples are just as close to the training data as they are to the holdout data (the data not seen during training).

### Distances (DCR) metric now uses embeddings

{/* MSD-878 */}
The **Distances** metric is now improved to use embeddings for both tabular and text columns. As embeddings aim to capture the semantic similarities between words, the metrics now calculate the L2 distance between samples converted to JSON that are then embedded in a vector space and the distances between samples are then compared.

For details, see [_Distances_](/generators/evaluate-quality#distances).

### Improved resilience of running generators and synthetic datasets

{/* MSD-890 */}
MOSTLY AI now supports improved mechanisms to ensure that running generators and synthetic datasets complete training and generation successfully even in the case of unexpected infrastructure interruptions. Such failures can be the result of evicted compute nodes due to cluster resource polices that may reschedule a resource for other tasks.

For running generators, the training process automatically restarts from the last checkpoint with the saved model weights to ensure that training progress is never lost due to unexpected interruptions.

### Improvements

- {/* MSD-845 */} Selected compute now appears for each model in the **Training status** and **Generation status** sections
- {/* MSD-868 */} Get the actual datetime of when a generator or synthetic dataset was created by hovering over the time elapsed value next to the **Created by** field

_Sep 16th, 2024_

### Resolved issues

- {/* MSD-911 */} Resolved an issue to ensure that users continue with their previous workflow and are not redirected to the Home page when the authentication token expires but the session is still valid.

## v301

_Sep 13th, 2024_

### Clone generators

If you want to reuse the configuration of a generator, you can now use the new **Clone** operation. The **Clone** operation is available for all existing generators with the sole exception of those with file uploads. For such cases, you need to re-create the generator and re-upload the original files.

For details, see [_Clone a generator_](/generators/manage#clone-a-generator). In addition, you can also check out the [_Clone a synthetic dataset_](/synthetic-datasets/manage#clone-a-synthetic-dataset) section.

### Improvements

- {/* MSD-846 */} Redirect to login after session timeout
- {/* MSD-xxx */} Cap length of Nested Sequence Context to 20 to limit peak memory

### GPU support

{/* MSD-??? */}

MOSTLY AI introduces Nvidia CUDA GPU support for your synthetic data workloads 🎉

Our testing shows that you can now achieve the following with GPUs:

- ~2x to ~5x speedups of generator training across most single-table and multi-table scenarios
- ~24x speedup of generator training for datasets with sequence lengths of 100
- ~2x to ~9x speedups of synthetic data generation across most single-table and multi-table scenarios

With flexible computes now supported, you can assign the same or separate GPU computes to each AI model task, either when you train a generator, or when you generate synthetic data. For example, for your subject table AI model training you can use a CPU compute, and for linked tables with long sequences you can select a GPU compute and reduce overall training times.

To start, you can now define your custom compute that includes GPU and select the compute that best fits the needs for each task. For details, see [_Flexible compute_](#flexible-compute).

### Flexible compute

{/* MSD-665 */}

With _flexible compute_, we want to enable all custom deployments of MOSTLY AI to define flexible compute resources.

As long as the underlying hardware supports a compute resource with a defined number of CPUs and memory, or a defined number of GPUs and GPU memory, you can add a custom compute.

Thereafter, you can assign each AI model to use a different compute. This applies to both generator training and synthetic data generation.

For details, see [_Compute_](/administration/compute) in the _Administration_ section.

### Easiest way to start Assistant chats

### File uploads in Assistant chats

The Assistant has made data insights easier than ever. And it can reason very well about your MOSTLY AI assets - generators and synthetic datasets. But you might also need to work with external data. The Assistant now supports this too.

You can now upload files in Assistant chats. You can do so with single or multiple files. Instant examples are typical data file types, such as CSV, Parquet, or Excel. But you can use any file type that an LLM can process.

For details, see [Upload files in Assistant chats](/assistant#upload-files).

### Add MOSTLY AI assets to Assistant chats

While you can use the **Explore** button from any generator or synthetic dataset to open the Assistant, you can now also add these assets directly to an Assistant chat. This way, you can easily refer to them in a conversation.

Use the new Resources menu and select either **Use a generator** or **Use a synthetic dataset** option. You are then able to select the asset from a UI list.

For details, see [Use a generator or a synthetic dataset](assistant#use-a-generator-or-a-synthetic-dataset).

### Python session status in Assistant chats

Each Assistant chat also runs a Python session in the background to run any Python code generated by the Assistant. That session expires after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can now track your Python session status in each chat. The session now is started as soon the chat is created.

For details, see [Python session status](/assistant/python-session-status).

### Improvements

We want you to focus on generating synthetic data and we are adding the term to the top-level menu in the MOSTLY AI Synthetic Data Platform!

With that, we also want to say goodbye to **Jobs**. You served our users well and we are thankful for it!

### Source and destination connector types

You can now define each connector as either a data source or a destination. That way, you can only select destination connectors for your synthetic dataset destination and prevent the risk of selecting a data source as the destination.

### New design for synthetic datasets summary

When you now open a synthetic dataset from the new **Synthetic datasets** tab, a new summary page provides easier access to the preview of sample data, the QA report, the tracking of the synthetic dataset progress, and the configuration of the synthetic dataset.

You can use the sidebar on the right to quickly access each section.

- **Overview**
- **Sample data**
- **QA Report**
- **Logs**
- **Configuration**

### Numeric (Auto) encoding type

The new encoding type **Numeric (Auto)** is now auto-assigned to columns that contain numeric data. **Numeric (Auto)** uses heuristics to automatically assign the relevant one of the available Numeric encoding types: **Discrete**, **Digit**, or **Binned**.

You no longer need to worry about which **Numeric** encoding type you need to use. Just select **Numeric (Auto)**.

## v111

_Aug 17th, 2023_

### New Numeric encoding types

You can now select from three different **Numeric** encoding types: **Digit**, **Discrete**, and **Binned**.

### Preview of synthetic data is now available for shared jobs

The **Synthetic data** tab in a completed job is now available on shared jobs. When you share a link to a completed job with your team, they can now access the **Synthetic data** tab in the job and preview the generated synthetic data in the job.

### Drop tables in the destination

The new option **Drop tables in the destination** in the **Output settings** will drop any tables that match the names of the tables in your synthetic data job. MOSTLY AI drops the tables at the start of the job before it completes AI model training and data generation.

You can enable **Drop tables in the destination** after you start a new job and select a database connector as the destination. The option is not available for cloud storage connectors.

### Search database tables when adding them to a catalog

In v110, MOSLTY AI introduced a drop-down to add tables from a database. You can now enter a search term in the drop-down to filter the list of tables and more easily find the table you want to add.

## v110

_Aug 3rd, 2023_

### Support for multiple tables in ad hoc and cloud storage jobs

You can now create and configure multi-table jobs not only with databases, but also with file uploads and cloud storage catalog jobs.

### New Tables tab in job configuration

For each job configuration, the new **Tables** tab gives you a list of all tables in the job. The **Tables** tab is also the new home of all training settings that were previously available in the **Training settings** tab. Moving forward, the **Training settings** tab will be no longer available.

In the **Tables** tab, you can now also add and remove tables from a job.

When you start a job, the **Tables** tab opens and contains no tables. You can add new tables with the **Add table** button. This action is supported in all job types: ad hoc, database catalogs, and cloud storage catalogs.

### Easier database catalog creation flow

With the new database catalog flow, you no longer need to identify subject tables and rank them.

After you select a database connector, MOSTLY AI shows the new **Tables** tab where you can now add tables from your cloud buckets or databases and remove any tables that you no longer need.

### Easier configuration of table relationships

You can now use the **Foreign key** option in **Generation method** to define relationships between tables. This is now available in the **Data settings** tab during job configuration.

To mark a table as a linked table, specify which of its columns is set as a Context foreign key to another table.

### Table relationships configuration is no longer required to start a job

You can now start a job with two or more subject tables. You no longer need to define a relationship and mark any of the tables as a linked table.

### Reference tables are now only available in old catalogs

With v110 of MOSTLY AI, the concept of reference tables is no longer available for any newly created jobs or catalogs. All tables in a job are either a subject table (by default) or a linked table (after you set a foreign key to another table). You can only view reference tables in catalogs that you created before v110.

However, you can no longer change the configuration of reference tables, such as set any primary or foreign keys.

### Updates in Generate more data

You can now use **Generate more data** for all job types including database catalog jobs.

With the capability to have ad hoc jobs with multiple uploaded subject tables, for such jobs you will now need to specify the number of new generated subjects or provide a table seed for every subject table in the job.

### Resolved issues

- **MCD-2071** Implemented better precision when handling primary keys

## v109

_Jul 19th, 2023_

### Use different types of data sources and destinations for the same job

Regardless of the type of data source you use for your original data, you can now deliver the generated synthetic data into any type of destination that suits your downstream tasks.

You can now select a different type of connector for the delivery of your synthetic data, so you can mix and match, such as use original data from Databricks but deliver the synthetic data into Snowflake, or use original data from a Microsoft SQL Server database and deliver the synthetic data into a PostgreSQL database.

## v108

_Jul 6th, 2023_

### Preview generated synthetic data

When a synthetic data job completes, you can now preview the first up to 100 samples from each generated synthetic table.

### Share links to generated synthetic data

With MOSTLY AI, you can now share links to completed synthetic data jobs with anyone. Send the links to colleagues or data-minded friends and they can download the generated synthetic data and review all available QA reports.

### Improved star schema support with better handling of correlations between linked tables

We improved the support of star schemas and now provide better handling of the correlations between linked tables. In such cases, synthetic linked tables with correlations now have better quality and accuracy.

### SSL support in PostgreSQL connectors

You can now configure your PostgreSQL connectors to use secure SSL connections to the database.

### Job progress is now updated every second

As you track the progress of a running job from the **Jobs** tab or in the **View tasks** drawer, the progress is now updated every second to provide a more responsive experience.

### Resolved issues

- **MPD-3220** - In the previous version, when you clicked **Stop generation** while looking at a job progress in the **View tasks** drawer, the job would continue generating data and ignore the action. We have now resolved this issue and clicking **Stop generation** now takes immediate effect.
- **MCD-1952** - When a column is set as both a primary key and a foreign key in the original data, MOSTLY AI prioritizes the foreign key relationship and the issue is handled gracefully.
- **MCD-1951** - Resolved an issue when MOSTLY AI writes primary keys in UUID format that are longer than the maximum number of characters allowed by the column data type in the destination database

## v107

_Jun 21st, 2023_

### Databricks support

You can now create Databricks connectors and use Databricks catalogs as a data source or destination for your generated synthetic data.

### Coherence report for linked tables

The **Model QA report** and **Data QA report** now contain a **Coherence** tab for linked tables (event & time-series data). In the **Coherence** tab, you can find bivariate plots that show how well the sequence and logic of events is preserved in the synthetic data.

### Auto-update of training settings based on selected training goal

When you set the **Training goal** for a synthetic data job, MOSTLY AI now auto-updates the training settings **Maximum training epochs** and **Training samples** to values appropriate for the selected training goal.

<div className="empty_header_table"></div>| | | | --- | :--- | | **Accuracy** | **Maximum training epochs** is set to **100**| | **Speed** |<ul>
  <li>**Maximum training epochs** is set to **10**</li>
  <li>**Training samples** is set to **100000**</li>
</ul>| | **Turbo** |<ul>
  <li>**Maximum training epochs** is set to **1**</li>
  <li>**Training samples** is set to **10000**</li>
</ul>|

### Actual and maximum theoretical accuracy in QA report

The **Accuracy** tab in the **Model QA report** now shows maximum theoretical accuracy in parenthesis, next to the actual accuracy for each column.

### Improvements

### BigQuery support

You can now create BigQuery connectors and use BigQuery as a data source or destination for your generated synthetic data.

### Use the new Turbo training goal for quick synthetic data jobs

For testing purposes, you might need to run and complete synthetic data jobs rapidly without the need for accuracy. For such cases, you can now use the new **Turbo** training goal. When you select **Turbo**, MOSTLY AI automatically sets the **Maximum training epochs** setting to **1** and reduces the training time to a minimum so that you can get a quickly generated synthetic dataset.

### Improvements

- MPD-3105 - The **Data settings** screen now shows the type of mock data you selected for a column.
- MPD-2476 - You can now set **Encoding type**: **ITT** for more than one column in a linked table.

### Resolved issues

- MPD-3084 - The metric **Context columns** no longer appears in the QA report for subject tables.
- MCD-1812 - `_RARE_` token values in **Categorical** columns in the input dataset are now considered as actual categories and no longer result in the crashing of synthetic data jobs.
- MCD-1868 - We made optimizations to reduce the number of jobs that fail with `OutOfMemory` errors.
- MCD-1982 - Empty linked tables (that have columns defined but contain no rows) no longer crash synthetic data jobs. MOSTLY AI generates the same empty tables in the synthetic dataset.

## v105

_May 25th, 2023_

### Performance improvements

After a number of performance optimizations to our database and queries, the MOSTLY AI Synthetic Data Platform now supports even more simultaneous synthetic data jobs.

### Resolved issues

MPD-3147 - Due to some incorrect assignments of foreign keys in specific cases, we disabled the auto-assignment of foreign keys when you upload subject and linked table files.

## v104

_May 16th, 2023_

### Snowflake support

You can now create Snowflake connectors, and with that, read original data directly from as well as write synthetic data directly to your Snowflake databases.

### Auto-detection of CSV data types

MOSTLY AI now instantly recognizes the correct data types for uploaded CSV files. Previously, this was done as part of the data synthesis.

With this change, the Encoding Type **AUTO** is now deprecated.

### Support for Gzip and Bzip2 files

You can now speed the provisioning of large files by uploading them as Gzip (`.gz`) or as Bzip2 (`.bz2`) archive files.

### Support for TSV files

You can now upload TSV (tab-separated values) files.

### Specify single files from cloud buckets

Previously, you were only able to specify the containing folders as a cloud bucket. With this release, you can now specify the path to individual files on a bucket.

### Support for JSON Lines, Feather and ORC format (experimental)

You can now provide your original data as [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/), [Feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html), or [ORC](https://orc.apache.org/) format.

### Resolved issues

## v2.0

_Nov 2nd, 2021_

_Synthetize your data wherever it is_

Mostly AI 2.0 is now capable of synthesizing entire databases!

It connects to your data sources, recognizes its columns and their relationships, and provides you with a synthetic version of your data wherever you need it.

There are no more limits to what you can synthesize. Connect to your databases, buckets, and files without any hurdles.

Be ready for the synthetic data revolution. It's already here.

### New UI

_A new customer centric UI_

With Mostly AI 2.0 we introduce a new UI!

The new UI has been redesigned with a customer centric approach.

The task of creating a new synthesization job has never been easier.

And it looks cool too!

### Multi-table data catalog

_Synthesize complex data structures_

With Mostly AI 2.0 it is now possible to define multi-table data catalogs!

The complexity of your data source is now represented in the data catalog:

- Support of primary keys,
- Support of foreign keys,
- and Referential integrity.

The platform understands the relationships between all the tables and create a synthesization plan based on these relationships.

The result is synthetic version of your data in its original form!

### Parallel computing

_Better performance thanks to parallelization_

Thanks to a major architectural redesign, the Mostly AI platform now supports parallel computing.

In case of multi-table synthetic generation, the Mostly AI platform will intelligently divide the tasks that can be calculated in parallel in the available VMs.

### Data connectors

_Create your data source once and re-use it!_

You can now define data connectors in the Mostly AI platform!

Data connector can be used as a source of data or as a data destination.

You can fetch data from your production data lake or database and push them wherever you need!

### Mock data

_A perfect way to test the extremes_

Some of the biggest challenges when testing software can be getting the software into some very specific states. You want to test that the new error message works, but this message is only shown when something breaks. You may have no direct control over and you really need to manipulate this data in order to perform your tests.

You can now define Mock Data in the generation process!

Mock data makes it possible to simulate errors and circumstances that would otherwise be very difficult to create in a real world environment.

### New QA report

_A new and intuitive QA report_

The new QA Report is available directly in the UI. You can explore the results of your generation job and see if there are privacy or accuracy warnings!
