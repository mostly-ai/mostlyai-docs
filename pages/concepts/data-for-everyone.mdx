# Data for everyone

Data for everyone is more than just our product, it's our mission. But what do we mean exactly when we talk about concepts like data democratization and data for everyone?

## Data democratization

Democracy, from the combination of the ancient Greek words _demos_ (people) and _kratos_ (power), is generally understood to be a form of government where the people control the levers of power. In the context of data, we think democracy is just as important.

In a world where your time is commoditized and you personal information is a currency, we believe that controlling your organizational data and protecting your data subjects' privacy is paramount.

MOSTLY AI offers best-in-class [privacy protection](./privacy-protection) when generating synthetic data, but that's just part of the story.

We also firmly believe that anyone with a keen interest (rather than a data science background) ought to be able to extract insight and value from a given [dataset](/datasets).

## Data for everyone

Artificial intelligence has made reasoning with data more accessible than ever. More and more teams (and more and more individuals) are seeing the world-changing potential delivered by this revolutionary technology. But chat-first tools can only explain complex relationships, spot patterns, and generate insights in the moment. Despite their brilliance in the moment, they remain limited by their closed environments.

They can’t install new packages that might be needed for a particular task or create sharable artifacts you can share with other data enthusiasts.

We think that’s a missed opportunity.

At MOSTLY AI, we believe in empowering everyone to work meaningfully with data. That’s why we created the MOSTLY AI Assistant: an environment where LLMs can operate with the full power of Python, where datasets carry their context and logic, and where outputs become living artifacts that can be explored and reused across teams.

Just as we believe privacy must be protected, we also believe insight should be unlocked.
