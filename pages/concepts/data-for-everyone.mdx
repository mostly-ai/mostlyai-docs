# Data for everyone

Data for everyone is more than just our product, it's our mission. But what do we mean exactly when we talk about concepts like data democratization and data for everyone?

## Data Democratization

Democracy, from the combination of the ancient Greek words _demos_ (people) and _kratos_ (power), is generally understood to be a form of government where the people control the levers of power. In the context of data, we think democracy is just as important.

In a world where your time is commoditized and you personal information is a currency, we believe that controlling your organizational data and protecting your data subjects' privacy is paramount.

MOSTLY AI offers best-in-class [privacy protection](./privacy-protection) when generating synthetic data, but that's just part of the story.

We also firmly believe that anyone with a keen interest (rather than a data science background) ought to be able to extract insight and value from a given [dataset](/datasets).
