# Context processing in multi-table schemas

MOSTLY AI provides powerful features for the training on and generation of multi-table datasets. For such datasets, the Sequential Context Processor (SCP) is a key feature that aids the generation of nested child tables with rich context from any surrounding tables. Thus, synthetic data that you generate with MOSTLY AI can fully retain the existing correlations between nested linked tables in complex schemas.

## Example of context processing

To examine how sequential context processing works, let's consider a multi-table scenario with six tables, as listed below.

* `customers` table
* `loans` table
* `payments` table
* `accounts` table
* `cards` table
* `transactions` table

The diagram below illustrates the relationships in this table schema.

For ease of reading, the text below refers to _**generating records in the context of other records**_. However, the same rules of context apply when training MOSTLY AI generators.

So, when you read _**generated in the context of**_, bear in mind that _**trained on in the context of**_ applies just as equally.

### `customers` table

At the top of the hierarchy is the `customers` table. This table acts as the primary context for all child and grandchild tables that follow in the hierarchy. This is also known as a **subject table**.

### `loans` table

The `loans` table is the first child table in the hierarchy. Along with the parent `customers` table, both tables represent a two-table scenario, where the `customers` table is a **subject** table and the `loans` table is a **linked** table.

The records in the `loans` table are generated in the context of the parent records from the `customers` table.

    alt="Two tables - the context are the parent records"
    width={600}
    height={90}
/>

In addition, each record in the `loans` table is generated in the context of all **same-table sibling** records. Let's consider how the `loans` records are generated for the parent `Lucia Garcia`.

After the first `loan` record for `Lucia Garcia` is generated, that first record is then used as context for the second `loan` record of `Lucia Garcia`.

    alt="Same-table siblings context - generating the 2nd record"
    width={600}
    height={90}
/>

Afterwards, all previously generated sibling records (with parent `Lucia Garcia`) are passed as context for each new sibling to be generated.

    alt="Same-table siblings context - generating the 3rd record"
    width={600}
    height={90}
/>

To summarize, when MOSTLY AI generates a `loan` record, it does so in the context of:

* **parent** `customer` record (`Lucia Garcia`)
* **same-table sibling** `loan` records (the second `Consumer` loan is generated in the context of the first two loans `Consumer` and `Mortgage` of `Lucia Garcia`)

### `payments` table

The `payments` table is the first grandchild table in the hierarchy. It is a child to the `loans` table, and a grandchild to the `customers` table.

When MOSTLY AI generates a `payment` record, it does so in the context of:

* the **grandparent** `customer` record (`Lucia Garcia`)
* **parent** `loan` record (`Consumer` loan)
* **parent sibling** `loan` records (the `Mortgage` and the two `Consumer` loans)
* **same-table sibling** `payment` records (the `payment` records that belong to the same `Consumer` loan)

The context not used is as follows:

* **same-table cousin** records (`payment` records that belong to other `loan` parent records)

    alt="Three tables - context are the parent and grandparent records"
    width={800}
    height={90}
/>

### `accounts` table

The `accounts` table is the second child to the `customers` table and a sibling to the `loans` table. Just like the `customers` records, the `accounts` records are generated in the context of the `customers` records.

However, what the Sequential Context Processor includes is also the `loans` records as context. This means that every time an `account` record is generated, MOSTLY AI provides as context:

* **parent** `customer` record (`Lucia Garcia`)
* **cross-table sibling** `loan` records (the 2 `Consumer` loans and the `Mortgage` loan)
* **same table sibling** `account` records (the `Savings` account is passed as context when generating the `Checking` account)

The context not used is as follows:

* any records from the `payments` table

    src="/docimages/concepts/scp/04-four-tables.svg"
    alt="Three tables - context are the parent and cross-table siblings"
    width={800}
    height={90}
/>

### `cards` table

The `cards` table is the second grandchild table in the hierarchy. It is a child to the `accounts` table and a grandchild to the `customers` table.

When MOSTLY AI generates a `card` record, it does so in the context of:

* the **grandparent** `customer` record (`Lucia Garcia`)
* the **parent** `account` record (the `Savings` account of `Lucia Garcia`)
* all **same-table parent sibling** `account` records (the `Checking` account of `Lucia Garcia`)
* all **cross-table parent sibling** `loan` records (the 2 `Consumer` and 1 `Mortgage` records)
* all previously generated **same-table sibling** `card` records

The context not used is as follows:

* all **cross-table cousin** records from the `payments` table (`payments` records whose parent `loan` record has as parent `Lucia Garcia`)
* all **same-table cousin** records from the `cards` table (`cards` records that have another `account` as a parent whose parent is `Lucia Garcia`)

    alt="Three tables - context are the parent and cross-table siblings"
    width={800}
    height={90}
/>

### `transactions` table

The generation of the `transactions` records occurs with the richest context compared to the rest of the tables.

When MOSTLY AI generates `transaction` records for an`account` (for example, the `Savings` account as shown in the diagram below), it does so in the context of:

* the **grandparent** `customer` record (`Lucia Garcia`)
* the **parent** `account` record (the `Savings` account that belongs to `Lucia Garcia`)
* all **same-table parent sibling** `account` records (the `Checking` account that also belongs to `Lucia Garcia`)
* all **cross-table parent sibling** `loan` records (the 2 `Mortgage` and 1 `Consumer` loans that belong to `Lucia Garcia`)
* all **cross-table sibling** `card` records (the `Debit` and `Credit` cards that also belong to the same parent `Savings` account)
* all previously generated **same-table sibling** `transaction` records

The context not used is as follows:

* **cross-table cousin** records from the `cards` table (`cards` that have another `account` as parent whose parent is `Lucia Garcia`)
* **cross-table cousin** records from the `payments` table (`payments` records whose parent `loan` record belongs to `Lucia Garcia`)
* **same-table cousin** records from the `transactions` table (`transaction` records with a different `account` parent record that belongs to `Lucia Garcia`)
