# What is mock data?

Mock data is artificial data that corresponds to some broad criteria, but does not necessarily correlate to real-world trends based on some underlying subject dataset.

Mock data is distinct from [synthetic data](/concepts/what-is-synthetic-data), which is artificial data that retains the characteristics of real-world data. However, a key feature of synthetic data is that it does not directly correspond to real-world entities like people, organizations, institutions, and others contained in the original dataset.

## What is AI-generated mock data?

MOSTLY AI provides capabilities to generate mock data using the [MOSTLY AI Assistant](/assistant) or via the [MOSTLY AI Mock library](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostlyai-mock).

### Generative AI models

MOSTLY AI offers support for many generative AI models, including those from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and others. For the entire library of available models, see the [LiteLLM Providers documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/). You can also [provide your own model](/administration/models) hosted on Hugging Face.

### Mock data generation

With the trained AI model, MOSTLY AI performs random draws to generate a row of data in the mock data table. Because of this, each generated row does not correspond to the same sequential row from the original table. At the same time, the generated mock data table is highly accurate in its representation of the original data. The mock data retains the patterns, correlations, distributions, and dependencies of the original table data.

## Why AI-generated mock data?

Modern organizations collect and store substantial amounts of data, that include personal information, that they need to protect to ensure the privacy of their customers and business partners. Regulations (such as GDPR) aim to protect private data and make it particularly hard to make such data available for broader analysis, testing, or sharing.

One of the techniques that has been used over time to unlock data with private information for further utility is to anonymize personal details. [Anonymization, however, comes with more than a few challenges](https://mostly.ai/synthetic-data-platform/what-is-data-anonymization).

With AI-generated mock data, you can:

- Use LLMs to generate any tabular data to suit your needs.
- Create entire datasets from scratch, including those with complex relationships.
- Expand existing datasets to include new columns.
- Enrich existing tables with new columns.
- Use realistic and private data for testing and development.
