# Manage users and groups

When you deploy and host MOSTLY AI for your organization, you can manage access to MOSTLY AI with the Keycloak and Access Management services.

## Manage groups

With groups, you can manage a common set of access privileges for a set of users. Users can be members of zero or more groups. They inherit the access privileges assigned to each group.

**Steps**

1. Access Keycloak’s user interface by typing its URL in your browser’s address bar. It’s the same as MOSTLY AI’s URL, but with the `/auth` path at the end of it.<br />
For example, `https://mostlyai.mycompany.com/auth`.
2. Keycloak’s welcome page appears. Select Administration Console and enter the Admin credentials that were created during installation.
    * If you are running a Docker-based version of MOSTLY AI, you can find these credentials in the `docker-compose.yml` file located in the `/opt/mostly-ai/etc/` directory:
    The credentials are stored in the KEYCLOAK_USER and KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD fields.
        ```
        mostly-keycloak:
            image: mostlyai/mostly-keycloak:latest
            container_name: mostly-keycloak
            hostname: mostly-keycloak
            depends_on:
            - mostly-keycloak-postgres
            environment:
            - VIRTUAL_HOST=login.$MOSTLY_GENERATE_DOMAIN #login.mostly.mycompany.com
            - VIRTUAL_PORT=$MOSTLY_GENERATE_PORT  #8080
            - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=login.$MOSTLY_GENERATE_DOMAIN #login.mostly.mycompany.com
            - KEYCLOAK_USER=admin
            - KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=adminpassword123456789
            - DB_VENDOR=postgres
            - DB_ADDR=mostly-keycloak-postgres #mostly-keycloak-postgres
            - DB_PORT=5432 # 5432
            - DB_DATABASE=mostly_keycloak # mostly_keycloak
            - DB_USER=mostly_keycloak # mostly_keycloak
            - DB_PASSWORD=mostly_keycloak # mostly_keycloak
            - PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING=true
            - X509_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/mostly-keycloak-setup/enterprise_mostlylab.crt
        ```

    * If you are running a K8s / OCP version of MOSTLY AI, you can find them (base64 encoded) in the section `Keycloak.secrets`:
        ```
        secrets:
        ...
        admin_password: (base64 encoded)
        admin_username: (base64 encoded)
        ...
        ```


3. Once you’re in the **Administration Console**, click the drop-down menu in the top left and switch from the `master` to the `mostly-generate` realm. Then, select **Groups** from the menu on the left.<br />
    You can now see the user groups that are currently available.<br />
    Click **New** to create a new group or **Edit** to manage the access permissions of an existing group.

        alt="Keycloak 1"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
4. If you select **New**, a **Create group** page will appear where you can fill out the name of your new group. Click **Save** when done.
    <Image
        src="/docimages/administration/users-groups/groups-keycloak-2.webp"
        alt="Keycloak 2"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
5. On the next page, select the **Role mappings** tab to see the available and assigned roles for your group. Select the roles you want to assign and click on **Add selected**. You can leave Keycloak once you’re done.
    <Image
        src="/docimages/administration/users-groups/groups-keycloak-3.webp"
        alt="Keycloak 3"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
    We recommend assigning the roles that start with Manage, Use, View, and Stop. These are composite roles that combine one or more granularly defined roles. You can identify these by the underscore (_) at the beginning of their name. The table below lists all the composite roles you can choose from.


    | Role | Description |
    | --- | -- |
    | **ManageDataConnector** | Create, update, read, and delete connectors. |
    | **UseDataConnector**    | Use connectors for synthetic datasets and catalogs and see their details. |
    | **ManageDataCatalog**   | Create, update, read, and delete catalogs. |
    | **UseDataCatalog**      | Use catalogs to generate synthetic datasets and see their details. |
    | **ManageJobs**          | Start, stop, update, and delete synthetic datasets, and download its assets. |
    | **StopJobs**            | Stop a running synthetic dataset, exit the training and generation steps, and delete a synthetic dataset. |
    | **ViewJobs**            | View the synthetic datasets list and summary, including  progress, QA report, and download their assets.  |
    | **ManageUser**          | View the user list and user details, view the Active Directory connection details and update them, and syncronize Active Directory with MOSTLY AI's user directory. |
    | **UseAPI**              | Use all endpoints of the public API. |
    | **ManageAPI**           | Create an API key for the public API. |
    | **ManageGroupSharing**  | Change which groups have access to a synthetic dataset, catalog, or connector. |
    | **ManagePublicSharing** | Provide view access to a synthetic dataset, catalog, or connector to everyone. |
    | **ManageOwnerSharing**  | Change the owner of a resource. |
    | **Reporting**           | Enables the creation of the QA report. |

> If you create a group, MOSTLY AI will allow you to share Synthetic datasets, Catalogs and Connectors between the members of that group.

## Manage users

Follow the steps below to manually add users. Alternatively, you can also integrate Keycloak with your company’s Active Directory by following these steps.

**Steps**

1. Access Keycloak’s user interface by typing its URL in your browser’s address bar. It’s the same as MOSTLY AI’s URL, but with the `/auth` path at the end of it.<br />
For example, `https://mostlyai.mycompany.com/auth`.
2. Keycloak’s welcome page will now appear. Select Administration Console and enter the Admin credentials that were created during installation.

    * If you are running a Docker-based version of MOSTLY AI, you can find these credentials in the `docker-compose.yml` file located in the `/opt/mostly-ai/etc/` directory:
    The credentials are stored in the KEYCLOAK_USER and KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD fields.
        ```
        mostly-keycloak:
            image: mostlyai/mostly-keycloak:latest
            container_name: mostly-keycloak
            hostname: mostly-keycloak
            depends_on:
            - mostly-keycloak-postgres
            environment:
            - VIRTUAL_HOST=login.$MOSTLY_GENERATE_DOMAIN #login.mostly.mycompany.com
            - VIRTUAL_PORT=$MOSTLY_GENERATE_PORT  #8080
            - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=login.$MOSTLY_GENERATE_DOMAIN #login.mostly.mycompany.com
            - KEYCLOAK_USER=admin
            - KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=adminpassword123456789
            - DB_VENDOR=postgres
            - DB_ADDR=mostly-keycloak-postgres #mostly-keycloak-postgres
            - DB_PORT=5432 # 5432
            - DB_DATABASE=mostly_keycloak # mostly_keycloak
            - DB_USER=mostly_keycloak # mostly_keycloak
            - DB_PASSWORD=mostly_keycloak # mostly_keycloak
            - PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING=true
            - X509_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/mostly-keycloak-setup/enterprise_mostlylab.crt
        ```
    * If you are running a K8s / OCP version of MOSTLY AI, you can find them (base64 encoded) in the section `Keycloak.secrets`:
        ```
        secrets:
        ...
        admin_password: (base64 encoded)
        admin_username: (base64 encoded)
        ...
        ```

3. Once you are in Keycloak, click the drop-down menu in the top left and switch from the `master` to the `mostly-generate` realm. Then, click on **Users** in the left side menu and then on the **Add user** button on the **Users** page.
    <Image
        src="/docimages/administration/users-groups/users-keycloak-1.webp"
        alt="Users - Keycloak 1"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
3. If you’ve clicked on **Add user**, a new page appears where you can fill out their **Email**, **First Name**, and **Last Name**. Click **Save** when done.
    <Image
        src="/docimages/administration/users-groups/users-keycloak-2.webp"
        alt="Users - Keycloak 2"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
4. Next, the user profile page appears. Select the **Credentials** tab to set a password for this user account. Once you’ve entered the new password in the **Password** and **Password confirmation** fields, click **Set password** and confirm.
    <Image
        src="/docimages/administration/users-groups/users-keycloak-3.webp"
        alt="Users - Keycloak 3"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />

5. Switch to the **Groups** tab to assign the user to one or more groups.
    <Image
        src="/docimages/administration/users-groups/users-keycloak-4.webp"
        alt="Users - Keycloak 4"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />

> IMPORTANT: Make sure that your new users are at least in the Public group, plus any new group you create and want them to be a part of.

## Integrate Keycloak with Active Directory

Take the following steps to integrate Keycloak with your company’s Active Directory:

**Steps**
