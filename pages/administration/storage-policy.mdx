# Storage policy

The MOSTLY AI storage workflow guarantees that no original data ever leaves the customer environment.

MOSTLY AI runs as a set of containerized applications and services that you can deploy in your own Kubernetes cluster and maintain a fault-tolerant and highly available application.

The storage system of MOSTLY AI is MinIO or a compatible S3 storage. Storage is only used to store the following:

* Aggregate analysis and lookup tables for encoding-decoding
* AI model weight files
* Configurations
* Synthetic data
* Quality reports

The only place where original data is accessed is in the training job, which is a Kubernetes job. The original data is stored temporarily on the jobâ€™s volume, which is destroyed by Kubernetes when the job finishes. Hence, there is no original data stored in the MinIO storage.

MOSTLY AI uses two types of Kubernetes storage classes.

* **Block Storage**. Used by single pods, such as PostgreSQL and the license file.
* **Shared Storage**. Shared by various pods to store models, synthetic data, and others.

For more information on all supported storage classes, see [Storage classes](https://docs.mostly.ai/install/architecture#supported-kubernetes-storage-classes).
