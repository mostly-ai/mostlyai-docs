# Computes

With flexible computes, you can define compute resources from Kubernetes clusters that you can then assign to run your generator training and synthetic data generation workloads. You can use compute resources to add GPU-capable compute that can significantly speed up the time to train new generators and generate synthetic datasets.

## Add a new compute

You can define any of your existing Kubernetes compute resources as a new compute in MOSTLY AI.

**Prerequisites**

- Before you define a new compute, confirm the available compute resources in your Kubernetes cluster.
- You need to be an account Super Admin to add a new compute.

### Kubernetes compute

**Steps**

1. From the profile menu, select **Computes**.
2. On the Computes page, click **+ New compute**.
3. Select **Kubernetes**.
4. Define the compute configuration.
   | Kubernetes compute parameter | Description |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Name** | A unique name for the compute. |
   | **CPUs** | The number of CPU cores. |
   | **Memory** | The amount of memory. |
   | **GPUs** | The number of GPUs. |
   | **GPU memory** | The amount of GPU memory. |
   | **Toleration** | A toleration that matches the taint defined for your cluster.<br /><br />⚠️ Leave empty if in the `values.yaml` you need to set the `mostly_coordinator.deployment.core_job.tolerationOperator` to `Exists`.|
   | **Order Index** | The order in which the compute appears in the **Compute** drop-down.<br />The default compute has `order_index=1`. |

5. Click **Save**.

**Result**

The next time users configure a new generator training or synthetic dataset, they can select the new compute from the **Compute** drop-down list.

In addition, the new compute remains available in the **Computes** list. A Super Admin can edit or delete it at any time.

## Edit a compute

You can make changes to exising computes.

**Steps**

1. Open the **Compute** kebab menu and select **Edit**.
2. Change the compute configuration.
3. Click **Save**.

**Result**

The compute configuration is now updated.

## Delete a compute

You can delete an existing compute from its kebab menu.

<Callout>Do not delete the **Default** compute as all common steps for generators and synthetic datasets rely on its availability.</Callout>

**Steps**

1. Open the **Compute** kebab menu and select **Delete**.
2. Click **Yes, delete compute** in the confirmation pop-up.
