# Public and private assets

In MOSTLY AI, all assets (generators, synthetic datasets, connectors, assistant threads) are private immediately after you create them. You can make [generators](/generators) and [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets) public to share with the world or keep them private for internal use.

<CustomCallout>
[Connectors](/connectors) and [assistant threads](/assistant) are always private and cannot be made public. However, you can [export an assistant thread as a Jupyter Notebook](/assistant/manage-threads#export-as-a-jupyter-notebook).
</CustomCallout>

| Asset | Default visibility | Visibility options | Organizations visibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Generators | <PrivateAssetIcon/>Private | <PublicAssetIcon/>Public<br /><PrivateAssetIcon/>Private | <PublicAssetIcon/>Public<br /><PrivateAssetIcon/>Private (within organization) |
| Synthetic datasets | <PrivateAssetIcon/>Private | <PublicAssetIcon/>Public<br /><PrivateAssetIcon/>Private | <PublicAssetIcon/>Public<br /><PrivateAssetIcon/>Private (within organization) |
| Connectors | <PrivateAssetIcon/>Private | <PrivateAssetIcon/>Private | <PrivateAssetIcon/>Private (within organization) |
| Assistant threads | <PrivateAssetIcon/>Private | <PrivateAssetIcon/>Private<br /><br />Can be [exported and shared as a Jupyter Notebook](/manage-threads#export-as-a-jupyter-notebook) | Cannot be transferred to an organization |

<Callout>
If you move a generator or synthetic dataset that you have made public to an organization, the asset remains public from within the organization.
