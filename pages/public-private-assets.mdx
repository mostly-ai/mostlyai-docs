# Public and private assets

In MOSTLY AI, all assets (generators, synthetic datasets, connectors, assistant threads) are private immediately after you create them. You can make [generators](/generators), [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets), and [connectors](/connectors) public to share with the world. Alternatively, you can keep them private for your internal use or that of your organization's.


[Assistant threads](/assistant) are always private and cannot be made public. You can, however, [export an assistant thread as a Jupyter Notebook](/assistant/manage-threads#export-as-a-jupyter-notebook).

<Callout>
The following applies to **public assets**:

* If you made a generator, synthetic dataset, or connector public before transferring it to an organization, the asset will remain public. It will be visible from the organization profile.
* Public assets are visible to everyone, including people who are not part of your organization.
