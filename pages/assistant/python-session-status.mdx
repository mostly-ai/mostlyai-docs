# Python session status

Each [chat](./manage-chats) has a dedicated Python environment, where all code suggested by the Assistant runs to deliver data insights and produce [artifacts](./artifacts).

After you create a new chat, the Python session is initialized in the background before it becomes ready for use. Until then, the Python session status is **Initializing**.

After the Python session becomes available, its status changes to **Running**.

After 10 minutes of inactivity, the Python session status changes to **Inactive**.

## Handle inactive Python sessions

When a Python session becomes inactive due to inactivity, it is automatically restart when you resume a chat with the Assistant.

<Callout type="info">Your uploaded files remain available even after the Python session restarts, so you can continue working with your data seamlessly.</Callout>

The Assistant automatically restarts the process and informs you if any previously defined variables need to be recreated due to the session restart.
