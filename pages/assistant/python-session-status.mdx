# Python session status

Each new Assistant chat runs a Python environment. It is in the Python environment where all Python code suggested by the Assistant runs to deliver data insights and visualizations.

After you create a new chat, the Python session is initialized in the background before it becomes ready for use. Until then, the Python session status is **Initializing**.

After the Python session becomes available, its status changes to **Running**.

After 10 minutes of inactivity, the Python session status changes to **Inactive**.

## Handle inactive Python sessions

When a Python session becomes inactive due to inactivity, it can automatically restart when you run Python code again. The Assistant is aware when the session has restarted and will intelligently manage variables that are no longer available from the previous session.

<Callout type="info">
Your uploaded files remain available even after the Python session restarts, so you can continue working with your data seamlessly.
</Callout>

The Assistant will automatically handle the session restart process and inform you if any previously defined variables need to be recreated due to the session restart.
