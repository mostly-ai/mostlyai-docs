# Artifacts

In MOSTLY AI, an Artifact is a visual representation of data created by the [Assistant](/assistant). Artifacts are generated during a Chat at the request of a user. An artifact can be download and saved or shared with other users on MOSTLY AI or other platforms.

After they have been created, Artifacts are visible in the Artifact library. Access the library by clicking Artifacts in the left navigation panel.
