# Manage chats

Find out how to manage each new chat you have with the MOSTLY AI Assistant. You can share, delete, and rename each chat.

## Rename a chat

When you create a new chat, it has the name `[Unnamed]`. You can rename it to make it easier to find and manage.

**Steps**

1. On the **Assistant** page, click the chat you want to rename.
2. In the upper left, click the **Arrow** button close to the chat name.

        width={800}
        height={400}
    />
3. Click on Rename.
4. Enter a new name for the chat.

## Delete a chat

You can delete any chats you no longer need.

**Steps**

1. On the **Assistant** page, hover over a chat and click its kebab menu.
2. Select **Delete**.
3. To confirm, click **Yes, delete**.

## Export as a Jupyter Notebook

You can export assistant chats as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` file and any generated data and image files). Use the export to share your work with others or import in your own Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Steps**

1. Export in one of two ways.
    * On the **Assistant** page, hover over a chat and click its kebab menu.
    * With the Assistant chat open, in the upper left, click the **Arrow** button close to the chat name.
        <Image

            alt="MOSTLY AI - Assistant - Export as Jupyter Notebook - Click kebab menu"
            width={800}
            height={400}
        />
2. Select **Export as ipynb**.
3. Select the location where you want to save the file and click **Save**.

**Result**

The chat contents are downloaded in a `.zip` file that contains the Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb`file and any generated data and image files.

Here is an example from an Assistant chat containing a generated `.csv` file with mock data and the generated pie chart.
