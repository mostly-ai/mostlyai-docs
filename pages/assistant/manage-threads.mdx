# Manage threads

Find out how to manage each new thread you have with the MOSTLY AI Assistant. You can share, delete, and rename each thread.

## Rename a thread

When you create a new thread, it has the name `[Unnamed]`. You can rename it to make it easier to find and manage.

**Steps**

1. On the **Assistant** page, click the thread you want to rename.
2. In the upper left, click the **Edit** button.
    <Image

        alt="MOSTLY AI - Assistant - Rename a thread - Click Edit"
        width={800}
        height={400}
    />
3. Enter a new name for the thread.

## Delete a thread

You can delete any threads you no longer need.

**Steps**

1. On the **Assistant** page, hover over a thread and click its kebab menu.
2. Select **Delete**.
3. To confirm, click **Yes, delete**.

## Export as a Jupyter Notebook

You can export assistant threads as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` file and any generated data and image files). Use the export to share your work with others or import in your own Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Steps**

1. Export in one of two ways.
    * On the **Assistant** page, hover over a thread and click its kebab menu.
    * With the Assistant thread open, click the kebab menu.
        <Image

            alt="MOSTLY AI - Assistant - Export as Jupyter Notebook - Click kebab menu"
            width={800}
            height={400}
        />
2. Select **Export as ipynb**.
3. Select the location where you want to save the file and click **Save**.

**Result**

The thread contents are downloaded in a `.zip` file that contains the Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb`file and any generated data and image files.

Here is an example from an Assistant thread containing a generated `.csv` file with mock data and the generated pie chart.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="Mock-Data-with-sample-GitHub-profiles" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="Mock Data with sample GitHub profiles.ipynb" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="data" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="mock_data.csv" />
      <FileTree.File name="country_distribution_pie_chart.png" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
