# Quick start

Welcome to the MOSTLY AI Quick start guides! Training new AI models on your tabular data and using them to generate privacy-safe synthetic data has never been easier.

## Quick starts for Model creators and Data consumers

- **Model creators** are the guardians of original data and own the training of new AI models that make data privacy-safe for further utility.
- **Data consumers**, through MOSTLY AI, have easy access to synthetic data they can analyze, use for downstream machine learning (ML) tasks, and share freely, without the privacy concerns.

## Quick start for fine-tuning LLMs

MOSTLY AI can easily integrate with any LLM for further fine-tuning on tabular datasets that contain columns with unstructured text data.
