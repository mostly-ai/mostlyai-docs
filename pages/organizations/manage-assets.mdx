# Manage organization assets

You can grow your organization's portfolio by adding synthetic data assets.

## Add assets

You can add the following types of assets to an organization:

- [generators](/generators)
- [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets)
- [connectors](/connectors)

To add assets, you [transfer the ownership of the asset from your personal account to the organization](#transfer-an-asset-to-a-user-or-organization). An asset's initial owner is always the creator's account. Assets cannot start with an organization as the owner, but their ownership can always be transferred back to your account.

## Transfer an asset to an organization

In MOSTLY AI, you can transfer any generator, synthetic datasets, or connector you create to an organization.

After the transfer, even if the creator of an asset deletes their account, the asset will not be deleted and its owner will remain the organization transferred to.

Transferring is not available in the few specific cases listed below.

* To another user
* To an organization you are not a member of
* Between two organizations where in one or both you do not have the Admin or Contributor role

**Prerequisites**

* You are the creator of the asset you want to transfer.
* You have the Admin or Contributor role in the organization you want to transfer the asset to.
* You can transfer generators and synthetic datasets only when their status is **Ready**. For details, see [_Status of generators_](/generators/manage#status-of-generators) and [_Status of synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets/manage#status-of-synthetic-datasets).

**Steps**

1. Open an asset (generator, synthetic dataset, connector).
2. Click the kebab menu and select **Transfer ownership**.

        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-01-select-transfer-ownership.webp"
        alt="Transfer ownership - 01 - Kebab menu"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Select the user or organization to transfer the asset to.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-02-select-org.webp"
        alt="Transfer ownership - 02 - Select organization"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
4. Click **Save**.

**Result**

The asset is now part of the selected organizations's assets.

## Remove an asset

To remove an asset from an organization, you can do one of the following:

<div className="empty_header_table"></div>
| | |
| --- | --- |
| Delete the asset | • [Delete a generator](/generators/manage#delete-a-generator)<br />• [Delete a synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/manage#delete-a-synthetic-dataset)<br />* [Delete a connector](/connectors/manage#delete-a-connector) |
| Transfer the asset back to your account | Follow [Transfer an asset to an organization](#transfer-an-asset-to-an-organization). Instead of organization select your account. |

As a result, the asset will be no longer available to the organization members.
