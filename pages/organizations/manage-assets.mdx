2. Click the kebab menu and select **Transfer ownership**.

    />

    />

<div className="empty_header_table"></div>
| | |
| --- | --- |
| Delete the asset | • [Delete a generator](/generators/manage#delete-a-generator)<br />• [Delete a synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/manage#delete-a-synthetic-dataset)<br />* [Delete a connector](/connectors/manage#delete-a-connector) |
| Transfer the asset to a user or organization | [Transfer asset ownership](#transfer-an-asset-to-a-user-or-organization) |
