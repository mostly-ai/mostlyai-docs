# Manage organization assets

You can grow your organization's portfolio by adding synthetic data assets.

## Add assets

You can add the following types of assets to an organization:

- [generators](/generators)
- [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets)
- [connectors](/connectors)

To add assets, you transfer the ownership of the asset from your personal account to the organization. An asset's initial owner is always the creator's account. Assets cannot start with an organization as the owner, but their ownership can always be transferred to another account or organization.

While you can make generators and synthetic datasets assets [public](/public-private-assets) for the outside world to use, connectors always remain [private](/public-private-assets) and are only available within the organization.

<CustomCallout>
[Assistant threads](/assistant/manage-threads) are also always private and cannot be transferred to organizations. You can, however, share them with others by [exporting them as Jupyter Notebooks](/assistant/manage-threads#export-as-a-jupyter-notebook).
</CustomCallout>

**Prerequisites**

* You are the creator of the asset you want to transfer.
* You have the Admin or Contributor role in the organization you want to transfer the asset to.
* You can transfer generators and synthetic datasets only when their status is **Ready**. For details, see [_Status of generators_](/generators/manage#status-of-generators) and [_Status of synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets/manage#status-of-synthetic-datasets).

**Steps**

1. Open an asset (generator, synthetic dataset, connector).
2. Click the kebab menu and select **Transfer ownership**.

        alt="Transfer ownership - 01 - Kebab menu"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Select the organization to transfer the asset to.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-02-select-org.webp"
        alt="Transfer ownership - 02 - Select organization"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
4. Click **Save**.

The asset owner in the header changes to the organization name.

/>

## Remove an asset

To remove an asset from an organization, you can do one of the following:

<div className="empty_header_table"></div>
| | |
| --- | --- |
| Delete the asset | • [Delete a generator](/generators/manage#delete-a-generator)<br />• [Delete a synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/manage#delete-a-synthetic-dataset)<br />* [Delete a connector](/connectors/manage#delete-a-connector) |
| Transfer the asset to a user or organization | [Transfer asset ownership](#transfer-an-asset-to-a-user-or-organization) |

As a result, the asset will be no longer available to the organization members.

## Transfer an asset to a user or organization

You can transfer an asset to any user or organization on the platform.

With the transfer, the ownership of the asset is transferred to the organization. Even if the creator of the asset deletes their account, the asset will not be deleted, and its owner will remain the organization.

**Prerequisites**

You can only transfer generators and synthetic datasets with the status **Ready**. For details, see [_Status of generators_](/generators/manage#status-of-generators) and [_Status of synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets/manage#status-of-synthetic-datasets).

**Steps**

1. Open an asset (generator, synthetic dataset, connector).
2. Click the kebab menu and select **Transfer ownership**.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-01-select-transfer-ownership.webp"
        alt="Transfer ownership - 01 - Kebab menu"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Select the user or organization to transfer the asset to.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-02-select-org.webp"
        alt="Transfer ownership - 02 - Select organization"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
4. Click **Save**.

**Result**

The asset now belongs to the user or organization transferred to. As a result, the asset is no longer under the organization.
