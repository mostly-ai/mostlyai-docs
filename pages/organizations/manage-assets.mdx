# Manage organization assets

You can grow your organization's portfolio by adding generators, synthetic datasets, and connectors.

While you can publish generators and synthetic datasets for the the outside world to use, connectors always remain private, and only available, within the organization.

## Add assets

As mentioned, you can transfer the following types of assets to an organization:

- [generators](/generators)
- [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets)
- [connectors](/connectors)

All assets first have their creator as the owner. Only after they are created can their owner transfer them to an organization.

**Prerequisites**

You can only transfer generators and synthetic datasets with the status **Ready**. For details, see [_Status of generators_](/generators/manage#status-of-generators) and [_Status of synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets/manage#status-of-synthetic-datasets).

**Steps**

1. Open an asset (generator, synthetic dataset, connector).
2. Click the kebab menu and select **Transfer ownership**.

        alt="Transfer ownership - 01 - Kebab menu"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Select the organization to transfer the asset to.

        alt="Transfer ownership - 02 - Select organization"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
4. Click **Save**.

The asset owner in the header changes to the organization name.

/>

## Remove an asset

To remove an asset from an organization, you can do one of the following:

<div className="empty_header_table"></div>
| | |
| --- | --- |
| Delete the asset | • [Delete a generator](/generators/manage#delete-a-generator)<br />• [Delete a synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/manage#delete-a-synthetic-dataset)<br />* [Delete a connector](/connectors/manage#delete-a-connector) |
| Transfer the asset to a user or organization | [Transfer asset ownership](#transfer-an-asset-to-a-user-or-organization) |

As a result, the asset will be longer available to the organization members.

## Transfer an asset to a user or organization

You can transfer an assets to any user or organizations in the platform.

With the transfer, the ownership of the asset is transferred to the organization. Even if the the creator of the asset deletes their account, the asset will not be deleted and its owner remains the organization.

**Prerequisites**

You can only transfer generators and synthetic datasets with the status **Ready**. For details, see [_Status of generators_](/generators/manage#status-of-generators) and [_Status of synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets/manage#status-of-synthetic-datasets).

**Steps**

1. Open an asset (generator, synthetic dataset, connector).
2. Click the kebab menu and select **Transfer ownership**.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-01-select-transfer-ownership.webp"
        alt="Transfer ownership - 01 - Kebab menu"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Select the user or organization to transfer the asset to.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-02-select-org.webp"
        alt="Transfer ownership - 02 - Select organization"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
4. Click **Save**.

**Result**

The asset now belongs to the user or organization transferred to. As a result, the asset is no longer available to the organization members.
