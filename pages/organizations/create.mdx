Create an organization for your company, team, or project. This will allow you to develop and collaborate on a portfolio of synthetic data assets. You can also use organizations to manage access to assets and share them publicly or within your team and organization.

Create an organization for your company, team, or project to develop and collaborate on a portfolio of synthetic data assets. You can also use organizations to manage access to assets and share them publicly or within your team and organization.

On the profile page of an organization, users logged into the platform (that are not organization members) can find all of the organization's [public assets](/public-private-assets).

**Steps**

1. From the sidebar, click **+ New organization**.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/create-01-sidebar-new-organization.webp"
        alt="Create a new organization"
        width={250}
        height={300}
    />
2. Set the **Organization display name**.
    <CustomCallout>
    As you type the **Organization display name**, the **Organization name** is also updated, with lower-case characters and spaces replaced with hyphens. If needed, you can tweak the organization name.
    
    Naming rules apply as to what characters you can use in the **display name** and in the **organization name**. For details, see [_About organization names_](#about-organization-names).
    </CustomCallout>
3. (Optional) Upload the organization logo.
    If you do not upload a logo, MOSTLY AI will assign one of six random logos to the organization. You can always update it later.
