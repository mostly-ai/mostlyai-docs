# Create an organization

Create an organization for your company, team, or project to develop and collaborate on a portfolio of synthetic data resources. You can also use organizations to manage access to resources and share them publicly or within your team and organization.

**Steps**

1. From the sidebar, click **+ New organization**.

        alt="Create a new organization"
        width={250}
        height={300}
    />
2. Set the **Organization display name**.
    <CustomCallout>
    As you type the **Organization display name**, the **Organization name** is also updated, with lower-case characters and spaces replaced with hyphens. If needed, you can tweak the organization name.
    
    Naming rules apply as to what characters you can use in the **display name** and in the **organization name**. For details, see [_About organization names_](#about-organization-names).
    </CustomCallout>
3. (Optional) Upload the organization logo.
    If you do not upload a logo, MOSTLY AI will assign one of six random logos to the organization. You can always update it later.

        height={300}
    />
4. Click **+ Create organization**.
