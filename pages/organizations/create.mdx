## Create an organization

Create an organization for your company, team, or project to establish a portfolio of synthetic data assets.

Each organization has a profile page. On the profile page, users logged into the platform (that are not organization members) can also find all of the organization's assets that have been made public.

<CustomCallout>
Each organization's profile is public.
</CustomCallout>

2. Set the organization display name. If needed, tweak the organization name. For details, see [_About organization names_](#about-organization-names).

    MOSTLY AI assigns one of 6 random logos to the organization if you do not upload one. You can always update that later.
