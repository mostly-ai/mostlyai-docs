## Create an organization

Create an organization to create your organization's profile and use it as a publication vehicle for your synthetic data assets.

<CustomCallout>
Each organization has a public profile.

    />
2. Set the organization display name. If needed, tweak the organization name. For details, see [_About organization names_](#about-organization-names).
3. (Optional) Upload the organization logo.
    MOSTLY AI assigns one of 6 random logos to the organization if you do not upload one. You can always update that later.

## About organization names

Organizations have two names: the **display name** and the **organization name**.

* The **display name** appears on the organization profile page and in the organizations list on the sidebar.<br /><br />
    **Naming rules**:
    * _any characters are allowed_
    * _64 characters max length_
* The **organization name** is automatically set while you are typing the **display name** using the naming rules below.<br /><br />
    **Naming rules**:
    * _all letters are converted to lower-case_
    * _spaces are replaced with hyphens_
    * _special characters are omitted_
    * _leading, trailing, double-dashes are not allowed_
    <CustomCallout>
    You can edit the **organization name** following the naming rules.
