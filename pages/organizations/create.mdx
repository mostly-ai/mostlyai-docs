**Steps**

1. From the sidebar, click **+ New organization**.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/create-01-sidebar-new-organization.webp"
        alt="Create a new organization"
        width={250}
        height={300}
    />
2. Set the organization display name.
    <CustomCallout>
    The **display name** appears on the organization profile page.

    The **organization name** is auto-generated from the display name. The rules below apply:
    
    * _lower-case letters only_
    * _hyphens replace white spaces_
    * _special characters are ommitted_
    * _leading, trailing, double-dashes are not allowed_
    </CustomCallout>
3. (Optional) If needed, tweak the organization name. Bear in mind the requirements listed above.
3. (Optional) Upload the organization logo.
    MOSTLY AI assigns one of 6 random logos to the organization if you do not upload one. You can always update that later.

        alt="Create a new organization - 02 - Set display name, organization name, and logo"
        width={400}
        height={300}
    />
4. Click **+ Create organization**.

**Result**

The organization is created and you are redirected to the organization profile page.
