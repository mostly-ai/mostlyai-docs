# Manage organization members

Grow your organization by sending out invites for new members to join. You can assign roles to members based on their responsibilities and remove any members that no longer participate.

## Invite members to an organization

To add a new member, send them an invite link. The invite link is valid for 72 hours and can be used by multiple people to join the organization.

**Prerequisites**

Only a team member with the Admin role can generate an invite link and copy it for sending. For more information, see [_Roles and permissions_](/organizations/roles-and-permissions).

**Steps**

1. On the organization page, click **Settings**.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/delete-01-click-settings.webp"
        alt="Delete an organization - 01 - Click settings"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
2. Under **Members**, click **Copy** to copy the invite link.
    <Image

        alt="Invite members to an organization - 02 - Copy invite link"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Share the invite link with the people you want to invite.
    <Callout>
    The invite link is valid for 72 hours. Multiple people can use the same link to join the organization.
    </Callout>

**Result**

When members accept the invitation, they are then listed as part of the organization members. Their default role is **Viewer**.

<Image

    alt="Accept an organization invitation - 01 - Organization members"
    width={700}
    height={300}
/>

You can change the role of a member at any time. For more information, see [_Change the role of a member_](#change-the-role-of-a-member).

## Accept an invitation

When people open the invitation link, they are greeted with a prompt to accept your organization's invitation. When accepted, they automatically become part of the organization.

**Steps**

1. Open the invitation link.
2. In the dialog, click **Accept**.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/accept-01-click-accept.webp"
        alt="Accept an organization invitation - 01 - Accept"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />

## Change the role of a member

As your organization grows, you can assign roles to members based on their responsibilities. There are three roles you can assign to members:

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Admin | Has full access to the organization, its assets, and organization settings. |
| Contributor | Can add new assets, edit and delete existing ones. |
| Viewer | Can only view assets. |

<Callout>
An organization must have at least one Admin. If you are the only Admin, you cannot change your role.
</Callout>

**Prerequisites**

Only a team member with the Admin role can change the roles of other members.

**Steps**

1. On the organization page, click **Settings**.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/delete-01-click-settings.webp"
        alt="Delete an organization - 01 - Click settings"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
2. Under **Members**, click the **Role** drop-down for the team member.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/change-member-role-02-select-role.webp"
        alt="Change the role of a member - 02 - Click Role"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />

## Remove a member

In the event that a team member no longer needs access to the organization, you can conclude their membership.

**Prerequisites**

Only a team member with the Admin role can remove a member from the organization.

**Steps**

1. On the organization page, click **Settings**.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/delete-01-click-settings.webp"
        alt="Delete an organization - 01 - Click settings"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
2. Under **Members**, click **Remove** for the team member.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/remove-member-02-click-remove.webp"
        alt="Remove a member from an organization - 02 - Click Remove"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. In the confirmation dialog, click **Yes, remove member**.

**Result**

The now former team member no longer has access to the organization and its private assets.
