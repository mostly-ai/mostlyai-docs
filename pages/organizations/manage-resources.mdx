# Manage organization resources

You can grow your organization's portfolio by adding synthetic data resources.

## Add resources

You can add the following types of resources to an organization:

- [generators](/generators)
- [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets)
- [connectors](/connectors)

To add resources, you [transfer the ownership of the resource from your personal account to the organization](#transfer-an-resource-to-a-user-or-organization). A resource's initial owner is always the creator's account. Resources cannot start with an organization as the owner, but their ownership can always be transferred back to your account.

## Transfer a resource to an organization

In MOSTLY AI, you can transfer any generator, synthetic datasets, or connector you create to an organization.

After the transfer, even if the creator of a resource deletes their account, the resource will not be deleted and its owner will remain the organization transferred to.

Transferring is not available in the few specific cases listed below.

* To another user
* From/to an organization where you do not have sufficient permissions

**Prerequisites**

* You are the creator of the resource you want to transfer.
* You have the Admin or Contributor role in the organization you want to transfer the resource to.
* You can transfer generators and synthetic datasets only when their status is **Ready**. For details, see [_Status of generators_](/generators/manage#status-of-generators) and [_Status of synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets/manage#status-of-synthetic-datasets).

**Steps**

1. Open a resource (generator, synthetic dataset, connector).
2. Click the kebab menu and select **Transfer ownership**.

        alt="Transfer ownership - 01 - Kebab menu"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Select the user or organization to transfer the resource to.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-02-select-org.webp"
        alt="Transfer ownership - 02 - Select organization"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
4. Click **Save**.

**Result**

The resource is now transferred to the selected organization.

## Remove a resource

To remove a resource from an organization, you can do one of the following:

<div className="empty_header_table"></div>
| | |
| --- | --- |
| Delete the resource | • [Delete a generator](/generators/manage#delete-a-generator)<br />• [Delete a synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/manage#delete-a-synthetic-dataset)<br />* [Delete a connector](/connectors/manage#delete-a-connector) |
| Transfer the resource back to your account | Follow [Transfer a resource to an organization](#transfer-a-resource-to-an-organization). Instead of organization select your account. |

As a result, the resource will be no longer available to the organization members.
