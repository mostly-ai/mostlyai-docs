# Manage organization resources

You can grow your organization's portfolio by adding synthetic data resources.

## Add resources

You can add the following types of resources to an organization:

- [generators](/generators)
- [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets)
- [connectors](/connectors)

To add resources, you [share the resource from your personal account to the organization](#share-a-resource-with-an-organization). A resource's initial owner is always the creator's account. Resources cannot start with an organization as the owner, but they can always be shared back to your account.

## Share a resource with an organization

In MOSTLY AI, you can share any generator, synthetic datasets, or connector you create with an organization.

After sharing, even if the creator of a resource deletes their account, the resource will not be deleted and its owner will remain the organization shared to.

Sharing is not available in the cases listed below.

* To another user
* From/to an organization where you do not have sufficient permissions

**Prerequisites**

* You are the creator of the resource you want to share.
* You have the Admin or Contributor role in the organization you want to share the resource to.
* You can share generators and synthetic datasets only when their status is **Ready**. For details, see [_Status of generators_](/generators/manage#status-of-generators) and [_Status of synthetic datasets_](/synthetic-datasets/manage#status-of-synthetic-datasets).

**Steps**

1. Open a resource (generator, synthetic dataset, connector).
2. Click the kebab menu and select **Share**.
    <Image
        src="/docimages/organizations/add-assets-01-select-share.webp"
        alt="Share - 01 - Share button"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Select the organization to share the resource to.
    <Image
        src="/docimages/organizations/add-assets-02-select-share-org.webp"
        alt="Share - 02 - Select organization"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
4. Click **Save**.

**Result**

The resource is now shared with the selected organization.

## Remove a resource

To remove a resource from an organization, you can do one of the following:

<div className="empty_header_table"></div>
| | |
| --- | --- |
| Delete the resource | • [Delete a generator](/generators/manage#delete-a-generator)<br />• [Delete a synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/manage#delete-a-synthetic-dataset)<br />* [Delete a connector](/connectors/manage#delete-a-connector) |
| Share the resource back to your account | Follow [Share a resource to an organization](#share-a-resource-to-an-organization). Instead of an organization, select your account. |

As a result, the resource will be no longer available to the organization members.
