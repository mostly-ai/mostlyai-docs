# Edit organization settings

Make your organization profile stand out by adding or updating the logo, display name, website, and description. You can also use the settings to edit the organization [_account settings_](#organization-account-settings). Additionally, you can manage [_team members_](#members) and [_delete the organization_](#delete-organization).

<CustomCallout>
Only team members with the Admin role can edit the organization settings. For more information, see [_Roles and permissions_](/organizations/roles-and-permissions).
</CustomCallout>

## Organization profile settings

Use the profile settings to update the logo, display name, website, and the description and build a stunning-looking profile.

### Logo

Drag and drop a square logo (aspect ratio 1:1) into the upload area. There are no limitations on the logo size. The logo appears on the _sidebar organizations list_ and the _organization profile_.

### Display name

You can find the organization display name in two positions: the _sidebar organizations list_ and the _organization profile_. For details, see [_About organization names_](/organizations/create#about-organization-names).

### Website

Add the organization website URL. The website is then listed on the _organization profile_.

### Description

Write a captivating description for your organization. Use [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) to apply structure and formatting.

## Organization account settings

The organization account settings include the organization name and email.

### Organization name

When you create the organization, the organization name is automatically updated based on the display name in all lower-case characters, hyphen-separated. You can tweak it following the rules in [_About organization names_](/organizations/create#about-organization-names).

The organization name must be unique across all organizations on the MOSTLY AI Platform.

The organization name prefaces the names of all resources in the organization. For example, if the organization name is `mostly-ai`, a generator named `us-census-income` appears as `mostly-ai/us-census-income`.

### Organization email

Set an email address so that others can contact your organization.

## Members

Use the **Members** section to manage the organization members. You can invite new members, change their roles, and if the time comes, remove them from the organization. For details, see [_Invite members_](/organizations/manage-members#invite-members-to-an-organization), [_Change the role of a member_](/organizations/manage-members#change-the-role-of-a-member), and [_Remove a team member_](/organizations/manage-members#remove-a-member).
