# Edit organization settings

Make your [organization profile](#organization-profile-settings) stand out by adding a logo, display name, website, and a description. You can also use the settings to edit the organization [_account settings_](#organization-account-settings), manage [_team members_](#members), and [_delete the organization_](#delete-organization).

## Organization profile settings

Add a logo, display name, website, and a description to make a stunning oranization profile.

### Logo

Drag and drop a logo in the upload area. Use a logo with size of up to 100x100 pixels.

### Display name

You can find the organization display name in two positions: the _sidebar organizations list_ and the _organization profile_. For details, see [_About organization names_](/organizations/create#about-organization-names).

### Website

Add the organization website URL. The website is then listed on the organization profile page.

### Description

Write your organization description. Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to apply structure and formatting.

## Organization account settings

The organization account settings include the organization name and email.

### Organization name

When you create the organization, the organization name is auto-generated based on the display name in all lower-case characters, hyphen-separated. You can tweak it following the rules in [_About organization names_](/organizations/create#about-organization-names).

The organization name must be unique across all organizations on the MOSTLY AI Platform.

The organization name prefaces the names of all assets in the organization. For example, if the organization name is `mostly-ai`, a generator named `us-census-income` appears as `mostly-ai/mostly-ai-generator`.

### Organization email

Set an email address so that others can contact your organization.

## Members

Use the Members section to manage the organization members. You can invite new members, change their roles, and remove them from the organization. For details, see [_Invite members_](/organizations/manage-members#invite-members-to-an-organization), [_Change the role of a member_](/organizations/manage-members#change-the-role-of-a-member), and [_Remove a team member_](/organizations/manage-members#remove-a-member).
