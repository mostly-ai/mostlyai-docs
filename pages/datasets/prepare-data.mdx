# Prepare your data

Before you create a dataset in MOSTLY AI, review some of the considerations and requirements that can help you avoid unexpected errors, maintain the privacy of the subjects (people, companies, or any other entities), and ensure better performance when exploring data.

- MOSTLY AI supports uploading datasets in any format.
  - If your original data is in CSV files, see [CSV file requirements](../generators/prepare-data/csv-requirements).
