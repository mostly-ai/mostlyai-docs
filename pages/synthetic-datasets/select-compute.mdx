# Select a compute environment

MOSTLY AI assigns the most appropriate compute for each new synthetic dataset. For example, if the generator includes fine-tuned LLMs, MOSTLY AI assigns a GPU compute, if one is available.

The assigned compute is used to perform the tasks listed below:

* generate the synthetic data for each table
* generate a Data report for each table ([if the Data report is enabled](/synthetic-datasets/evaluate-quality#disable-data-reports)).

You always have the option to select a different compute for a synthetic dataset.

**Steps**

1. On the **Synthetic dataset configuration** page, click **Compute** in the upper right.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/synthetic-datasets/select-compute/01-click-compute.webp"
        alt="Configure a synthetic datasets - Select a compute environment - 01 - Click Compute"
        width={800}
        height={300}
    />
2. From the **Compute** pop-up window, select a compute.
    <Image 
        src="/docs/docimages/synthetic-datasets/select-compute/02-select-compute.webp"
        alt="Configure a synthetic datasets - Select a compute environment - 01 - Select compute"
        width={800}
        height={300}
    />
3. Click **Proceed**.

**What's next**

You can now [generate the synthetic dataset](/synthetic-datasets/generate) with the selected compute. 

In addition, you can configure any of the remaining options on the **Synthetic dataset configuration** page. 

* [Set sample size and temperature](/synthetic-datasets/set-size-temp)
* [Rebalance columns](/synthetic-datasets/rebalance-columns)
* [Data imputation](/synthetic-datasets/data-imputation)
* [Configure fairness](/synthetic-datasets/fairness)
* [Conditional simulation](/synthetic-datasets/seeded-generation)
* [Deliver to a database or a cloud storage bucket](/synthetic-datasets/deliver)
