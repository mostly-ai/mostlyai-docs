# Quick start: Datasets

Datasets are collections of data that can be used to train [generators](/quick-start/model-creators) and create [synthetic data](/quick-start/data-consumers).

Follow these instructions to create a new dataset. You can share datasets with other MOSTLY AI users by making it public so others can use it to create synthetic data.

<Steps>
## Step 1: Create a dataset

<Tabs items={['Manual', 'Assistant']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. On the MOSTLY AI platform, open **Datasets** from the left-side navigation menu.
2. Click **New dataset**.
3. Configure the dataset parameters.

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name        | Human-readable name which identifies the dataset on the platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Description | Instructions and information to guide the Assistant and data consumers. Note that a dataset can consist entirely of just a description which provides the link to a data resource and instructions for the Assistant to download the dataset found at that location. |
| File upload | Upload any files to include in your dataset. You can include files that are not explicitly data, but can be used during analysis, such as geographical shapefiles.                                                                                                   |
| Connector   | Connect to [external data sources](quick-start/conector-quickstart) that have been configured in the platform.                                                                                                                                                       |

4. Click **Save**.

The dataset is now available on the **Datasets** page.

**What's next**

You can now use the dataset to train a generator or explore with the [Assistant](/assistant).

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. Start a new chat with the Assistant by clicking **New chat** in the left-side navigation menu.
2. Prompt the Assistant to create a new [dataset](/datasets) by providing natural language instructions.

```bash
Open the URL `https://github.com/mostly-ai/public-demo-data` and download an interesting dataset for me to explore.
```

3. Prompt the Assistant to create a dataset with the defined resource.

```bash
Create a dataset that contains the data that you've suggested.
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

**What's next**

After you've created a new dataset, you can use it to train a generator and generate synthetic data. You can also transfer it to an organization.

## Step 2: Share the dataset with your organization

1. Open the dataset from the **Datasets** page.
2. Click **Share** in the upper-right corner.
3. Select the organization to which to share the resource using the **Owner** dropdown and click **Save**.

The dataset is now available to all members of your organization and they can use it to create a generator or other [artifacts](/assistant/artifacts).

**What's next**

You can make the dataset public so that it is available to all logged-in users in the platform.

## Step 3: Make the dataset public

If your dataset might be of interest to other users, you can make it public. Be cautious not to share datasets which may contain any sensitive information.

1. Open the dataset from the **Datasets** page.
2. Click **Share**.
3. Select **Public** from the **Visibility** dropdown and click **Save**.

**Result**

Public datasets of organizations are listed on the organization's profile page.

They are also available on the **Datasets** page for all logged-in users.

**What's next**

To create a generator, see [Quickstart: Generators](model-creators).
