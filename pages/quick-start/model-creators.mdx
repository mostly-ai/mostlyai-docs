# Quick start for Model creators

As Model creators, you carry the torch of democratizing data within and outside of your organization!

Here is how you can quickly train a new generator on original tabular data. You can then transfer the generator to an organization and make it public. Peers, colleagues, and third parties can then use it to create privacy-safe synthetic data.

<Steps>
## Step 1: Train a generator

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
1. In MOSTLY AI, select the **Generators** page.
2. Click **+ New generator**.

        width={800} 
        height={150}
    />
3. Select **Upload file**, browse for a dataset, and click **Proceed**.

    **Note**<br />
    If you don't have one, download the [UCI Adult income dataset](/datasets/us-census-income.csv.gz).
    </CustomCallout>

        alt="MOSTLY AI - Train a generator - 02 - Click Upload files" 
        width={800} 
        height={150}
    />
4. At the **Data configuration** step, click **Configure models**.

        alt="MOSTLY AI - Train a generator - 04 - Click Configure models" 
        width={800} 
        height={150}
    />
5. At the **Model configuration** step, click **Start training**.

        src="/docs/docimages/quickstart/model-creators/train-generator-04-click-start-training.webp" 
        alt="MOSTLY AI - Train a generator - 04 - Click Start training" 
        width={800} 
        height={150}
    />
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
1. [Install the MOSTLY AI Python SDK](/python-sdk#installation).<br /><br />
    You can install and use the SDK in **Local** or **Client** mode.
    * In **Local mode**, you use the SDK with the compute resources on your local machine (or any Python environment) to [train generators](/generators/train) and [create synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets/generate).
    * In **Client mode**, you connect to a remote MOSTLY AI Platform instance and use its available compute resources.
    
    For details, see [_Local and Client modes_](/python-sdk#local-and-client-modes).<br /><br />
2. Create your first generator using the [US Census Income](/datasets#us-census-income-dataset) dataset, start its training, and wait for it to finish.
    <Tabs items={['Local mode', 'Client mode']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    ```python copy filename="python" {7}
    # 1. Load original data into a pd.DataFrame
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("https://mostly.ai/docs/datasets/us-census-income.csv.gz")

    # 2. Instantiate in Local use
    from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI
    mostly = MostlyAI(local=True)
    
    # 3. Create a generator and launch its training
    g = mostly.train(data=df, start=True, wait=True)
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    ```python copy filename="python" {7}
    # 1. Load original data into a pd.DataFrame
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("https://mostly.ai/docs/datasets/us-census-income.csv.gz")

    # 2. Instantiate in Client mode by connecting to a remote Platform instance
    from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI
    mostly_remote = MostlyAI(base_url="https://app.mostly.ai", api_key="INSERT_API_KEY")
    
    # 3. Create a generator and launch its training
    g = mostly.train(data=df, start=True, wait=True)
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

**What's next**

After the generator training completes, you can generate synthetic data. You can also transfer it to an organization. Data consumers from your organization can then too generate synthetic data.

## Step 2: Share the generator with your organization

1. In MOSTLY AI, open the generator from the **Generators** page.
2. Click **Share**.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-01-select-share.webp"
        alt="Share - 01 - Share button"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />
3. Select the organization to share the resource to.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/organizations/add-assets-02-select-share-org.webp"
        alt="Share - 02 - Select organization"
        width={700}
        height={300}
    />

**Result**

The generator is now available to all members of your organization and they can use it to generate synthetic data.

**What's next**

You can make the generator public so that it is available to all logged-in users in the Platform.

## Step 3: Make the generator public

Generators capture only the statistical characteristics of the original data and they never memorize data points. This makes it perfectly safe to make a generator public.

1. Open the generator from the **Generators** page.
2. Click **Share**.

        src="/docs/docimages/quickstart/model-creators/make-public-01-select-share.webp"
        alt="MOSTLY AI - Make the generator publc - 02 - Select organization"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />
3. Select **Public** and click **Save**.
    <Image
        src="/docs/docimages/quickstart/model-creators/make-public-02-select-public.webp"
        alt="MOSTLY AI - Make the generator publc - 02 - Select organization"
        width={800}
        height={150}
    />

**Result**

Public generators of organizations are listed on the organization's profile page.

    alt="MOSTLY AI - Make the generator publc - 03 - Public generator on organization profile"
    width={800}
    height={150}
/>

They are also available on the **Generators** page for all logged-in users.
