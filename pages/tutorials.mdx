# Tutorials

The [tutorial repository](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/) provides a comprehensive set of examples for exploring, evaluating, and validating synthetic data. Tutorials can be executed locally by cloning the repository and running the notebooks in Jupyter Lab, or accessed via Google Colab to run in a managed cloud environment. Each tutorial demonstrates a distinct capability of the synthetic data platform.
