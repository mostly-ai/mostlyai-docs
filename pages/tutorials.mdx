# Tutorials

Welcome! We're excited to share our <Link href="https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/" target="_blank">repository</Link> of tutorials with you, which will help you explore and validate the benefits of synthetic data. Simply clone the repository to your own environment and run it locally via Jupyter Lab, or make it even easier and run each tutorial directly on Google's cloud resources via Colab. Let's get started!
