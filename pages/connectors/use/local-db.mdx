# Use a local database as a source or destination

If you want to use a database running in your local environment as a data source or destination for synthetic data, you can use `ngrok` to expose the local database for external connections over the Internet and then add the `ngrok` forwarding address and port in a new MOSTLY AI connector.

## Task 1: Install `ngrok`

[`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) makes it possible to expose a locally running server to the Internet. To do so, you need an `ngrok` account and an `ngrok` authentication token.

**Steps**

1. Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup and sign up for an `ngrok` account.
2. Install `ngrok` with the steps for your operating system from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup.
3. Copy your authentication token from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken.

4. Add the authentication token to your local environment.
   ```bash copy
   ngrok config add-authtoken TOKEN
   ```

**Result**

`ngrok` can now use the token to connect to your account.

## Task 2: Run a local database

With [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you can quickly run a database locally as a Docker container just by defining a new service in a YAML file.

The steps below show how to run a PostgreSQL database.

**Steps**

1. Create a new YAML file with the name `mostly-ai-postgresql-compose.yaml` and paste the contents below.
   ```yaml filename="mostly-ai-postgresql-compose.yaml" copy
   version: '3.7'
   services:
     mostly_ai_sd_db:
       image: postgres
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: postgres
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: changeme
         POSTGRES_DB: my_synthetic_db
       ports:
         - '5432:5432'
       volumes:
         - mostly_ai_sd_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
   volumes:
     mostly_ai_sd_db:
   ```
2. Set the credentials and database name in the lines highlighted below.

   ```yaml filename="mostly-ai-postgresql-compose.yaml" {2-4}
   ---
   POSTGRES_USER: postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD: changeme
   POSTGRES_DB: my_synthetic_db
   ```

3. Run `docker compose` to start the service defined in the YAML file.
   ```bash copy
   docker compose -f ./mostly-ai-postgresql-compose.yaml logs
   ```

**Result**

The PostgreSQL database is now running locally.

## Task 3: Expose your database with `ngrok`

To expose your database from your local environment, you need to know the port at which the database service is listening. Check your database configuration for that. For example, the default port for PostgreSQL is `5432`, for MySQL - `3306`.

**Steps**

1. Run `ngrok` to expose your database port.
   ```bash copy
   ngrok tcp PORT
   ```
   **Step result**: `ngrok` randomly assigns a hostname and a forwarding port for your database.
2. Copy the forwarding address that is listed in the `ngrok` command status.

## Task 4: Create a connector

You can use your local database as a data source, data destination, or both. In either case, you need a separate connector (a source or a destination) in MOSTLY AI.

**Steps**

1. From the **Connectors** page, click **+ New connector**.
2. Select the connector type for your local database.
3. Provide the connector details.
   1. For **Access type**, select **Source** or **Destination**.
   2. For **Host**, paste the `ngrok` forwarding address.
   3. For **Port**, paste the `ngrok` forwarding port number.
      <Callout>You can find the **forwarding address** and **port** in the output of the `ngrok` command from [Task 3](#task-3-expose-your-database-with-ngrok).</Callout>
   4. For **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**, set the database credentials and the database name.
      <Callout>If you plan to use the same database as a source and destination, create a separate database for the destination connector to prevent potential loss of original data.</Callout>
      <Image src="/docimages/connectors/destination/local-db/destination-connect-config.webp" alt="Local database as a data destination - Destination connector configuration" width={325} height={150} />
4. Click **Save**.
