# Connector access types

When you create a connector, you can specify the type of access that the connector has to the data source. You can restrict connectors to be available only for generator training, to be available for reading data for analysis and ML tasks via the SDK and the Assistant, or to be available for both reading from and writing data to as a data destination.

| Access type        | Description                                                                                                                        |

| **Read data**      | The connector is available for reading data for generator training as well as analysis and ML tasks via the SDK and the Assistant. |
| **Write data**     | The connector is available for reading data as well as writing data to a data destination.                                         |

Set connector access type during creation. You can change the access type later by editing the connector.
