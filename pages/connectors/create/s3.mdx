# Use S3 storage for synthetic data

If you keep datasets in S3 storage (Amazon S3 or any S3-compatible storage service), you can synthesize them via an S3 connector in MOSTLY AI.

If you want to store the generated synthetic data in a S3 separate bucket, you need to create a second destination S3 connector that points to that bucket.

**Prerequisites**

When you use AWS S3, take into account the prerequisites listed below.

- Use only "long-term" credentials that include an _access key_ and a _secret key_. "Short-term" credentials also require a _session token_, which is not supported.
- To use AWS S3 paths containing partitioned Parquet datasets, your AWS credentials must have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.

**Steps**

1.  From the **Connectors** tab, click **Create connector**.
    <Image src="/docimages/connectors/create-connector-01-click.webp" alt="Click Create connector button" width={800} height={500} />
2.  From the **Create a new connector** window, select **S3 Storage**.

3.  From the **New connector** window, configure the connector.
    1. For **Name**, enter a name that you can distinguish from other connectors.
    2. For **Access type**, select whether you want to use the connector as a **source** or **destination**.
    3. For **Access key**, enter your AWS access key.
    4. For **Secret key**, enter your AWS secret key.

    5. For **Endpoint URL (optional)**, enter the endpoint URL of your S3-compatible storage service.
       <Callout>
         If you use Amazon S3, you can leave this field empty.
         <br />
         <br />
         If you use a different S3-compatible storage service, enter the endpoint URL of the service. For example: `https://play.min.io:9000`.
       </Callout>

    6. (Optional) To use an encrypted connection, select **Use SSL** and upload your certificate in the **CA certificate** field.
4.  Click **Save** to save your new AWS storage connector.<br /><br />
    MOSTLY AI tests the connection. If you see an error, check the connection details, update them, and click **Save** again.<br /><br />
    You can click **Save anyway** to save the connector disregarding any errors.

    If you use the Synthetic Data SDK, create an AWS S3 connector with `mostly.connect()` and provide a connector configuration dictionary as shown below.

```python copy filename="python" {3}
c = mostly.connect({
    "name": "S3 Connector",
    "type": "S3_STORAGE",
    "access_type": "SOURCE",
    "config": {
        "access_key": "AKIA******",
        "endpoint_url": "https://play.min.io:9000", # Required only for S3-compatible storage services
    },
    "secrets": {
        "secret_key": "******"
    },
    "test_connection": True
})
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

**What's next**

Depending on whether you created a **source** or a **destination** connector, you can use the connector as:

- [data source](../use/data-source) for a new generator
- [data destination](../use/data-destination) for a new synthetic dataset
