# Manage connectors

In MOSTLY AI, you can manage the connections to all of your synthetic data sources and destinations from the **Connectors** page.

## Edit a connector

You can edit the saved connection details for each connector.

This might be necessary only if MOSTLY AI encountered errors when saving the connector or when the connection details for a database or cloud storage bucket have since changed.

**Steps**

1. On the **Connectors** page, click a connector.
2. Update the connection details.
3. Click **Save**.<br /><br />
    MOSTLY AI checks if it can establish a successful connection. If you see an error, check the connection details, update them if necessary, and click **Save** again.<br /><br />
    You can disregard any errors by clicking **Save anyway** to save the connector details.

## Share a connector

You can share a connector with members of your organization, see [Manage Resources](./organizations/manage-resources.mdx#share-a-resource-with-an-organization)

## Delete a connector

You can delete any of your saved connectors as long as it is not in use by a generator or a synthetic dataset.

**Steps**

1. On the **Connectors** page, hover over a connector, open its kebab menu, and select **Delete**.

2. Click **Yes, delete connector** in the confirmation window.
