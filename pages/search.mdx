# Search and filtering

The Search bar offers direct access to all of your [generators](/generators), [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets), [connectors](/connectors), and [chats](/assistant) in MOSTLY AI. You also have dedicated search for each entity type. Each entity type you can also filter by the type of ownership: all, own, own organizations.

## Search all entity types

Based on keywords, you search within the names and descriptions of all entity types.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Synthetic Data SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
In the web application, enter a search term in the top **Search** bar to find entities whose name or description contains the keyword.

    width={800}
    height={500}
/>
</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
If you use the Synthetic Data SDK, use the `list()` method for `generators`, `synthetic_datasets`, and `connectors` along with the `search_term` parameter.

```python filename="python" copy
search_term = 'census'

g_search = mostly.generators.list(search_term=search_term)
sd_search = mostly.synthetic_datasets.list(search_term=search_term)
c_search = mostly.connectors.list(search_term=search_term)

# Combine all items into a single list
all_results = list(g_search) + list(sd_search) + list(c_search)

# Print all matching items
for i in all_results:
    print(i)
    print(f"{i.metadata.owner_name:}/{i.name}")
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search per entity type

For each entity type, you can filter the entities list from the dedicated search bar.

## Filter by ownership

For each entity type, use the Owner filter to show all entities, only your entities, or only entities from your organizations.
