# Search

You can use the search capabilities in the MOSTLY AI web application and Python SDK for easy access to all of your [generators](/generators), [synthetic datasets](/synthetic-datasets), and [connectors](/connectors).

Based on keywords, you search within the names and descriptions of all entity types.

<Tabs items={['UI', 'Python SDK']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
In the web application, enter a search term to find entities whose name or description contains the keyword.

If you use the Python SDK, use the `list()` method for `generators`, `synthetic_datasets`, and `connectors` along with the `search_term` parameter.

```python filename="python" copy
g_search = mostly.generators.list(search_term = 'census')
sd_search = mostly.synthetic_datasets.list(search_term = 'census')
c_search = mostly.connectors.list(search_term = 'PostgreSQL')
```

The result is a generator object you can iterate over.

```python filename="python" copy
for i in g_search:
    print(i)
```
